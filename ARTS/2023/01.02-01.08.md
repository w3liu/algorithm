## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
6. Z 字形变换
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
将一个给定字符串 s 根据给定的行数 numRows ，以从上往下、从左到右进行Z 字形排列。

比如输入字符串为 "PAYPALISHIRING" 行数为 3 时，排列如下：

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
之后，你的输出需要从左往右逐行读取，产生出一个新的字符串，比如："PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"。

请你实现这个将字符串进行指定行数变换的函数：

string convert(string s, int numRows);

示例 1：

输入：s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
输出："PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
示例 2：
输入：s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
输出："PINALSIGYAHRPI"
解释：
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
示例 3：

输入：s = "A", numRows = 1
输出："A"

提示：

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s 由英文字母（小写和大写）、',' 和 '.' 组成
1 <= numRows <= 1000

```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func convert(s string, numRows int) string {
	if numRows == 1 {
		return s
	}
	var letters = make([][]byte, numRows)
	var x int
	var direct int // 0 表示向下，1 表示向上
	for _, v := range s {
		letters[x] = append(letters[x], byte(v))
		if x == numRows-1 {
			direct = 1
		}
		if x == 0 {
			direct = 0
		}
		if direct == 0 {
			x++
		} else {
			x--
		}
	}
	var result []byte
	for i := 0; i < len(letters); i++ {
		result = append(result, letters[i]...)
	}
	return string(result)
}
```
### 4. 说明
采用矩阵来模拟Z型，找到方向变换的临界点，可以不用考虑空格所占用的位置，直接给二维数组后面追加数据即可。

The Lurn

It has often been said (by me) that a professional software developer never stops learning.

我经常说，一个专业的软件开发人员永远不会停止学习。

The Pragmatic Programmer book said it this way (p. 15):

《程序员的修炼之道》这本书是这么说的（第15页）：

Learn at least one new language every year.
Read a technical book each quarter.
Read non-technical books too.
Take classes.
Participate in local user groups.
Experiment with different environments.
Stay current.
Get Wired (blogs, redit, HN, YC, etc).
Good ideas all. But how does this jibe with the blog I wrote last month: 
The Churn which made the case that there is little to be gained by learning new languages and frameworks because our industry is approaching a kind of asymptote in language and framework technology. 
I mean, should we really learn at least one new language every year, if there’s nothing to be gained?

每年至少学习一种新语言。
每个季度读一本技术书籍。
非技术书籍也要读。
上课。
参与本地用户组。
体验不同的环境。
与时俱进。
获得连接（博客，redit，HN，YC 等等）。
这些都是好主义。但这与我上个月写的博客有什么关系呢?
《Churn》这篇博客表明学习新的语言和框架几乎没有什么收获，因为我们的行业正在接近语言和框架技术的渐近线。
我的意思是，如果没有收获，我们真的需要每年都学习一门新语言吗？

Yes. Of course. You should learn at least one new language every year. 
And if you do, you’ll eventually come to realize that the languages start to become repetitive. 
You’ll learn Lua, and realize it’s really just Javascript (or vice versa). 
You’ll learn Ruby and realize that it’s really just Python in different clothes. 
You’ll learn Swift and realize it’s just a rehash of Java with strong overtones of Pascal with some bangs (!) thrown in. 
You’ll learn GO and realize that it’s an amalgam of C, Java, and Erlang.

是的。当然。你每年至少需要学习一门新语言。
如果你这样做了，你最终会意识到这些语言开始变得重复。

You’ll begin to see the patterns behind all these languages, and recognize that those patterns are relatively few in number. 
It will eventually occur to you that the endless recombination of those patterns is rather like the search for the holy grail.

So, yes. Learn at least one new language every year so that you can come to the understanding that we’ve pretty well explored the language domain.

所以,是的。每年至少学习一门新语言，这样你就会明白我们已经很好地探索了语言领域。

The same is true of frameworks. Learn a new one every year or so. And when you do you’ll come to the realization that none of the new frameworks is actually “new” in any real sense. 
You’ll realize, as with languages, that the underlying patterns are relatively few in number; and that the endless recombination of those patterns approaches futility.

Is this a depressing viewpoint? It shouldn’t be. The fact that we’ve explored one small aspect of our profession does not mean that there aren’t other things to explore and learn. 
Yikes! The list of things to learn and improve upon is huge. What’s more, we’ve been neglecting those things in our endless churning search for new languages and frameworks.

呵!需要学习和改进的事情很多。更重要的是，我们在无休止地寻找新语言和框架的过程中忽略了这些东西。

So, for example, let’s talk about concurrency. This is something we suck at! Don’t you think it’s time we got better at it? 
Wouldn’t it be a good idea for us to explore the realm of concurrency as deeply as we’ve explored languages? 
Isn’t this especially true now as our applications are growing ever more dependent on multi-processor platforms, configurations, and deployments? 
Doesn’t the exponential advance of cloud based applications demand that we develop a very good understanding of concurrency?

Here, let me test your knowledge a bit:

Do you know the Dining Philosopher’s problem, and what it teaches?

你知道“用餐哲学家”的问题吗?

Can you define a deadly-embrace and describe how to avoid it?
Do you know what the actor model is?
Are you familiar with run-to-completion threads?
Have you ever written a circular buffer to communicate between an interrupt head and a background application?
Do you know what a semaphore is, who invented it, and why?
Are you familiar with the rationale behind double-checked locking?
What is priority inversion?
If you can’t answer a majority of those questions competently (after appropriate googling to disambiguate vocabulary differences) 
then I’d say you’ve got several glorious years of exploration ahead of you; and I advise you to take advantage of them.

Or, how about communication protocols. Have we explored this realm sufficiently? Do you know the domain?

或者，通信协议呢?我们是否充分地探索了这个领域?你知道域名吗?

Do you understand how unreliable connections are made to carry reliable communications?
Do you know what a sliding window protocol is?
How about a CRC?
Why is collision detection important to Ethernet?
What is exponential backoff?
What are the seven layers in the OSI model; and why are they important?
What is the difference between BPS and BAUD?
How well versed are you in the classics of our industry. Have you read and understood (just to mention a few):

The Art of Computer Programming: Knuth
Computer Networks: Tanenbaum
The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs: Abelson and Sussman
Structured Analysis and System Specification: DeMarco
Design Patterns: Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides
Analysis Patterns: Fowler
Structured Programming: Dijkstra, Dahl, Hoare
Object Oriented Software Construction: Meyer
Do you understand the difference between discrete event simulation and continuous simulation? When would you use them?

How’s your queueing theory? Do you understand how to organize a series of gates and queues to maximize throughput in various environments?

Are you familiar with graph algorithms? How would you find the shortest route between two towns? The fastest?

Could you write a quicksort on demand, without looking it up?

What is DeMorgan’s theorem, and why is it useful to you?

What is the difference between a Mealy and a Moore machine?

How’s your computational geometry? How would you calculate the area of an arbitrary polygon?

Have you written a genetic algorithm? Have you worked with a neural net? What do you know about Big Data. Have you written a floating point package? 
Have you written an IO driver? Have you written a file system? Have you written a multi-tasking nucleus Have you written a compiler?

And then there are languages. Have you learned the really important ones – the ones that truly were innovations – the ones that were the stepping stones that we took to get where we are? Have you learned Fortran? 
Have you learned Cobol? Have you learned Snobol, and Forth, and Lisp, and Prolog, and C?

Have you written in a machine language, hand assembling your code into binary? 
Have you read Alan Turing’s original paper: On Computable Numbers…?

*~~~*

So, yes. Learn at least one new language every year. And perhaps one of those new languages could be new – to you; but old and significant to our profession. 
And perhaps, while you are learning a new language, you could apply that learning to some of the other topics I mentioned here.

Our field is a rich one. We’ve barely scratched the surface. There are deep things to learn and understand about computing, and about software. 
It would be a shame if we never truly explored those depths because we kept on being distracted by shiny objects.

Bob大叔这篇文章表达了他对我们这个行业的一些看法，他认为软件行业是一个知识非常丰富的行业，我们需要不断的学习各种各样的知识，并且某些知识需要深入进去。

## Tip
### ES备份到对象存储
1. ES支持将索引备份到对象存储，官方支持S3，各个云厂商都有专门的插件支持备份到自家的对象存储。
2. 备份的时候是需要先创建一个存储库（repository）。
3. 存储库里可以创建多个快照，每个快照都是全量备份的。
4. 备份的时候可以指定需要备份的索引，默认是全部备份，包括系统索引。
