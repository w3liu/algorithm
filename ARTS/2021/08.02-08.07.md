## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
64. 最小路径和
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给定一个包含非负整数的 m x n 网格 grid ，请找出一条从左上角到右下角的路径，使得路径上的数字总和为最小。

说明：每次只能向下或者向右移动一步。

 

示例 1：


输入：grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
输出：7
解释：因为路径 1→3→1→1→1 的总和最小。
示例 2：

输入：grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
输出：12

```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func minPathSum(grid [][]int) int {
	var m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
	var dp = make([][]int, len(grid))
	dp[0] = make([]int, len(grid[0]))
	dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
	for i := 1; i < m; i++ {
		dp[i] = make([]int, len(grid[0]))
		dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
	}
	for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
		dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + grid[0][i]
	}
	for x := 1; x < m; x++ {
		for y := 1; y < n; y++ {
			dp[x][y] = int(math.Min(float64(dp[x-1][y]), float64(dp[x][y-1]))) + grid[x][y]
		}
	}
	return dp[m-1][n-1]
}
```
### 4. 说明
动态规划，dp用来存放最小路径的值，第一行和第一列需要特殊处理，最终返回`dp[m-1][n-1]`即可

Dance you Imps!

跳舞吧，小淘气！

There are several tools out there that promise to bridge the divide between objects and relational tables. 
Many of these tools are of high quality, and are very useful. They are collectively known as ORMs, which stands for Object Relational Mappers. 
There’s just one problem. There ain’t no such beast!

有些工具可以消除关系性表和对象之间的隔阂。
许多工具都有高质量并且非常有用。它们被统称为ORM，代表对象关系映射器。
只有一个问题。根本没这样的野兽。

The Impedance Mismatch

阻抗失配

It all started long ago, in the hinter-times of the 1980s. 
Relational databases were the big kids on the block. 
They had grown from their humble beginnings, into adventurers and conquerors. 
They had not yet learned to be: THE POWER THAT DRIVES THE INTERNET (TM); but they were well on their way. 
All new applications, no matter how humble, had to have a relational database inside them. 
The marketing people didn’t know why this was true; but that knew that is was true.

这一切都开始于很久以前，在20世纪80年代的暗示时期。
他们从卑微的出身成长为冒险家和征服者。
他们还没有学会成为:驱动互联网的力量(TM);但他们已经在路上了。
所有新的应用程序，无论多么简陋，都必须在其内部有一个关系数据库。
市场营销人员不知道为什么要这样;但他知道那是对的。

And then OO burst forth upon the land. 
It came as Smalltalk. It came as Objective-C, and it came, most importantly, as C++, and then Java and C#. OO was new. OO was shiny. OO was a mystery.

然后OO突然出现在陆地上。
它的名字是Smalltalk。它以Objective-C的形式出现，最重要的是，它以c++的形式出现，然后是Java和c#。OO是新的。OO是闪亮的。OO是一个谜。

Most creatures at the time feared new things. 
So they hid in caves and chanted spells of protection and exorcism. 
But there were imps in the land, who thrived by embracing change. 
The imps grabbed for the shiny new OO bauble and made it their own. 
They could feel its power. They could sense that it was good – very, very good; but they couldn’t explain why. So they invented reasons. 
Reasons like: It’s a closer way to model the real world! (What manager could say no to that?)

当时大多数生物都害怕新事物。
所以他们躲在洞穴里，吟唱保护咒语和驱魔咒语。
但这片土地上也有一些小淘气，他们通过拥抱变化而蓬勃发展。
小淘气们抓住了闪亮的新OO小玩意，并把它变成了自己的。
他们可以感受到它的力量。他们能感觉到它很好——非常非常好;但他们无法解释原因。所以他们发明了理由。
原因如下:这是一种更接近真实世界的建模方式!(哪个经理会拒绝呢?)

Then one day, when the OO imps were just minding their own business, doing their little dance of passing messages back and forth to each other, 
the RDBMS gang (pronounced Rude Bums) walked up to them and said: “If you imps want to do your impy little dance of passing your stupid messages back and forth in our neighborhood, then your bits are ours. 
You’re going to store them with us. Capisce?”

然后有一天，当OO的小鬼们只关心他们自己的事情，跳着他们来回传递信息的小舞蹈时，
RDBMS那帮家伙走过来对他们说:“如果你们这些小鬼想在我们的社区里跳你们那愚蠢的舞蹈来来回回传递你们的信息，那么你们的比特就是我们的了。
你要把它们储存在我们这里。你明白吗?”

What could the OO imps say? The Rude Bums ruled the roost; so, of course, they agreed. 
But that left them with a problem. The Rude Bums had some very strict, and very weird, rules about how bits were supposed to be stored.

OO的小鬼们能说什么呢?粗鲁的流浪汉统治着这里;所以，他们当然同意了。
但这给他们留下了一个问题。粗鲁的流浪汉有一些非常严格，也非常奇怪的规则，关于比特应该如何存储。

These rules didn’t sit well with the imps. When the imps did their impy message passing dance, they just sort of threw the bits back and forth to each other. 
Sometimes they’d hold the bits in their pockets for awhile, and sometimes they’d just toss them over to another impy dancer. 
In a full fledged impy dance, the bits just zoomed around from dancer to dancer in a frenzy of messages.

这些规定不受小鬼们的欢迎。当小淘气们跳着传递暗示信息的舞蹈时，他们只是把比特来回扔给彼此。
有时他们会把这些东西放在口袋里一段时间，有时他们会把它们扔给另一个含蓄的舞者。
在一种成熟的暗示性舞蹈中，比特只是在舞者之间快速移动，传递着疯狂的信息。

But the Rude Bums demanded that the bits be stacked up on strictly controlled tables, all kept in one big room. 
They imposed very strict rules about how those bits could be arranged, and where they had to be placed. 
In fact, there were forms to fill out, and statements to make, and transactions to execute. And it all had to be done using this new street banter named SQL (pronounced squeal).

但“粗鲁的流浪汉”们要求把碎片堆在严格控制的桌子上，所有的碎片都放在一个大房间里。
他们制定了非常严格的规则，规定如何安排这些比特，以及它们必须放置在哪里。
事实上，有表单要填写，有报表要做，有事务要执行。这一切都必须使用这个新的街头玩笑SQL(发音为squeal)来完成。

So all the OO imps had to learn squeal, and had to stack their bits on the Rude Bums tables, and had to fill out the forms and do the transactions, and that just didn’t match their dancing style. 
It’s hard to throw your bits around in the impy dance when you’ve got to stack your bits on tables while speaking squeal!

所以所有的OO imp都必须学会尖叫，必须将自己的片段堆叠在Rude bum的桌子上，必须填写表格并进行交易，而这与他们的舞蹈风格并不匹配。
当你不得不一边尖叫一边在桌子上堆叠你的部位时，你很难在暗示性舞蹈中把你的部位扔得到处都是!

This was the beginning of the Impy Dance Mismatch between OO and the Rude Bums.

这是OO和粗鲁的流浪者之间Impy Dance Mismatch的开始。

ORMs to the rescue, Not!

orm来救援，不!

The next decade saw a huge increase in the political power of the Rude Bums. 
They grabbed more and more territory, and ruled it with an iron fist. 
The imps also gained territory; possibly more than the Rude Bums; but they never managed to break free of the Rude Bums’ rules. 
And so they forgot how to dance. The free and lively OO dance they had done at the very beginning faded from their memory. 
It was replaced by a lock-step march around the Rude Bum’s tables.

在接下来的十年里，“粗鲁的流浪汉”的政治权力大幅增加。
他们占领了越来越多的领土，并以铁腕统治。
小鬼们也获得了领土;可能比那些粗鲁的流浪汉还多;但他们从来没有设法打破粗鲁流浪汉的规则。
所以他们忘了怎么跳舞。一开始自由活泼的OO舞在他们的记忆中渐渐消失了。
取而代之的是绕着粗鲁流浪汉的桌子的踏步。

Then, one day, some strangers appeared. They called themselves ORM (the OutRaged Mongrels). 
The Mongrels had seen the free OO dancing of the imps before the Rude Bums’ took control of them; and the Mongrels longed to see the imps dance free again.

然后，有一天，一些陌生人出现了。他们称自己为ORM(愤怒的杂种)。
在粗鲁的流浪汉控制他们之前，杂种们已经看到了小顽童们的免费OO舞;杂种狗们渴望看到小鬼们重新自由地跳舞。

So they came up with a plan. They would do the squealing! They would arrange the bits on the tables. 
They would fill out the forms and execute the transactions. They, the Mongrels, would stand between the imps and the Rude Bums and free the imps to dance once again.

所以他们想出了一个计划。他们会尖叫的!他们会把碎片放在桌子上。
他们将填写表格并执行交易。他们，杂种，会站在小鬼和粗鲁的流浪汉之间，让小鬼们再跳一次舞。

“Oh dance free you imps, dance free!”

"尽情跳舞吧，小鬼们，尽情跳舞吧"

But the imps didn’t dance free. They kept right on doing their lock-step march. 
Oh they were happy to have someone else take care of the nasty job of speaking squeal and arranging bits on the tables. 
They were happy that they didn’t have to deal directly with the Rude Bums. 
But now, instead of marching around the Rude Bum’s tables, they marched around the “Mongrels’” cabinets (which looked an awful lot like the Rude Bums’ tables).

但小鬼们并不是自由地跳舞。他们继续走紧锁步。
哦，他们很高兴有别人来处理这些讨厌的工作，比如说话、尖叫和在桌子上摆放东西。
他们很高兴不用直接和粗鲁的流浪汉打交道。
但现在，他们不是绕着粗鲁流浪汉的桌子游行，而是绕着“杂种”的橱柜游行(它们看起来很像粗鲁流浪汉的桌子)。

The Impy Dance Mismatch between OO and the Rude Bums had simply changed to the Impy Dance Mismatch between OO and ORMs.

OO和粗鲁的流浪者之间的Impy Dance Mismatch简单地变成了OO和orm之间的Impy Dance Mismatch。

Their ain’t no such mapping.

他们没有这样的映射。

An object is not a data structure. Repeat after me: An Object Is Not A Data Structure. OK, you keep repeating that while I keep talking.

对象不是数据结构。跟我重复:对象不是数据结构。好吧，你继续重复，我继续说。

An object is not a data structure. In fact, if you are the consumer of an object, you aren’t allowed to see any data that might be inside it. 
And, in fact, the object might have no data inside it at all.

对象不是数据结构。事实上，如果你是一个对象的消费者，你不允许看到任何可能在它里面的数据。
事实上，对象内部可能根本没有数据。

What do you see when you look at an object from the outside? You see methods! You don’t see any data; because the data (if any) is kept private. 
All you are allowed to see, from the outside looking in, are methods. So, from the outside looking in, an object is an abstraction of behavior, not an abstraction of data.

当你从外面看一个物体时，你会看到什么?你看到的方法!你看不到任何数据;因为数据(如果有的话)是私有的。
从外面往里看，你只能看到方法。所以，从外部看，一个对象是行为的抽象，而不是数据的抽象。

How do you store an abstraction of behavior in a database? 
Answer: You don’t! You can’t store behavior in a database. And that means you can’t store objects in a database. 
And that means there’s no Object to Relational mapping!

如何在数据库中存储行为的抽象?
答:你不!不能在数据库中存储行为。这意味着你不能在数据库中存储对象。
这意味着不存在对象到关系的映射!

OK, now wait!

好了,现在等待!

Yeah? Wait for what? You want to argue that point? Really? 
You say you’ve got an account object stored in the database, and you use hibernate to bring it into memory and turn it into an object with methods?

是吗?等待什么?你想论证一下吗?真的吗?
你说你有一个账户对象存储在数据库中，你用hibernate把它放到内存中，然后用方法把它变成一个对象?

Balderdash! Hibernate doesn’t turn anything into an object. 
All Hibernate does is to migrate data structures that are stored on a disk (a what? You still using disks? No wonder you’re confused.) to data structures stored in RAM. 
That’s all. Hibernate changes the form and location of data structures. Data structures, not objects!

胡言乱语!Hibernate不会将任何东西转换为对象。
Hibernate所做的一切就是迁移存储在磁盘上的数据结构(什么?你还在用磁盘吗?难怪你会感到困惑)到存储在RAM中的数据结构。
这是所有。Hibernate改变数据结构的形式和位置。数据结构，而不是对象!

What is a data structure? It’s a bunch of public data with no methods. 
Compare that to an object which is a bunch of public methods with no visible data. 
These two things are the exact opposites of each other!

什么是数据结构?它是一堆没有方法的公共数据。
将其与对象进行比较，对象是一堆没有可见数据的公共方法。
这两件事是完全相反的!

I could get into a whole theoretical lecture on the nature of data structures and objects, and polymorphism, and switch statements, and… But I won’t. 
Because the point of this article is simply to demonstrate that ORMs aren’t ORMs.

关于数据结构和对象、多态和switch语句的本质，我可以进行一场完整的理论讲座，但我不会。
因为本文的重点只是演示orm不是orm。

### What are ORMs?

### 什么是ORM？

ORMs are data structure migrators. 
That’s all. They move data from one place to another while making non-semantic changes to the form of that data. 
They do NOT create objects out of relational tables.

orm是数据结构迁移器。
这是所有。它们将数据从一个地方移动到另一个地方，同时对数据的形式进行非语义更改。
它们不会从关系表中创建对象。

Why is this important?

这为何重要？

It’s important because the imps aren’t dancing free! 
Too many applications are designed such that the relational schema is bound, in lock-step, to the business objects. 
The methods on the business objects are partitioned according to the relational schema.

这很重要，因为小鬼们是不会自由跳舞的!
太多的应用程序被设计成关系模式与业务对象绑定在一起。
业务对象上的方法根据关系模式进行划分。

Think about that for a minute. Think about that, and then weep. 
Why should the message pathways of an application be bound to the lines on a E-R diagram? What does the behavior of the application have to do with the structure of the data?

想想看。想想吧，然后哭吧。
为什么应用程序的消息路径要绑定到E-R图上的线?应用程序的行为与数据结构有什么关系?

Try this thought experiment. Assume that there is no database. 
None at all. There are no tables. No schema. No rows. No SQL. Nothing.

试试这个思维实验。假设没有数据库。
没有。没有表。没有模式。没有行。没有SQL。什么都没有。

Now think about your application. Think about the way it behaves. 
Group similar behaviors together by responsibility. 
Draw lines between behaviors that depend on each other. 
Do you know what you’ll wind up with? You’ll wind up with an object model. 
And do you know what else? It won’t look much like a relational schema.

现在考虑一下您的应用程序。想想它的行为方式。
根据责任将相似的行为归类。
在相互依赖的行为之间划一条线。
你知道你最后会得到什么吗?您将得到一个对象模型。
你知道还有什么吗?它看起来不太像关系模式。

Tables are not business objects! Tables aren’t objects at all. 
Tables are just data structures that the true business objects use as a resource.

表不是业务对象!表根本不是对象。
表只是真正的业务对象用作资源的数据结构。

### Moral

### 寓意

So, designers, feel free to use ORMs to bring data structures from the disk (the disk? You still using one?) into memory. 
But please don’t think of those data structures as your business objects. What’s more, please design your business objects without consideration for the relational schema. 
Design your applications to behave first. Then figure out a way to bind those behaviors to the data brought into memory by your ORM.

因此，设计人员可以随意使用orm从磁盘(磁盘?你还在用吗?)
但请不要将这些数据结构视为业务对象。此外，请在设计业务对象时不考虑关系模式。
首先设计你的应用程序的行为。然后想办法将这些行为绑定到ORM带入内存的数据上。

### 3. 点评
这篇文章，bob大叔介绍了他对ORM的认知，他人为表结构跟对象没有直接的关系，ORM不是从表结构生成对象，而只是对象用作资源的数据结构。
