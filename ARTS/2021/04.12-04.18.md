### 1. 题目
```
15. 三数之和
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给你一个包含 n 个整数的数组 nums，判断 nums 中是否存在三个元素 a，b，c ，使得 a + b + c = 0 ？请你找出所有和为 0 且不重复的三元组。

注意：答案中不可以包含重复的三元组。

 

示例 1：

输入：nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
输出：[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
示例 2：

输入：nums = []
输出：[]
示例 3：

输入：nums = [0]
输出：[]
 

提示：

0 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func threeSum(nums []int) [][]int {
	var n = len(nums)
	var results = make([][]int, 0)
	sort.Ints(nums)
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if nums[i] > 0 {
			break
		}
		if i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1] {
			continue
		}
		l := i + 1
		r := n - 1
		for l < r {
			res := nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
			if res == 0 {
				result := []int{nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]}
				results = append(results, result)
				for l < r && nums[l] == nums[l+1] {
					l++
				}
				for l < r && nums[r] == nums[r-1] {
					r--
				}
				l++
				r--
			} else if res > 0 {
				r--
			} else {
				l++
			}
		}
	}
	return results
}
```
### 4. 说明
* 首先对数组进行排序
* 对数组进行遍历
* 定义两个指针，一个从i+1开始为左指针，一个从n-1开始为右指针
* 判断三个数相加的值，分为三种情况，一种是等于0，一种是大于0，一种是小于0
* 然后针对三种情况分别移动指针
* 最后返回结果数组

The Letter

信

We need to become a self-regulating and self-policing profession. 
The stakes are simply too high to allow software to remain in the current ad-hoc limbo of hackers, heroics, and hermits.

我们需要变成一个自我调节和自我管理的从业者。
风险太大了，不能让软件停留在当前黑客、英雄主义和隐士的临时状态。

Consider how much software you interact with every day. 
Your alarm clock, your cell phone, the television and cable box, the remote control, your toaster oven, your watch, your car, the train to work, the cash register at Starbucks, 
the coffee maker at Starbucks, the elevator you ride, etc. etc. The list is virtually endless. 
Nearly every aspect of our daily lives, nearly ever corner of our civilization is somehow touched, controlled, managed, or influenced by software.

考虑一下，你每天与多少软件交互。
你的闹钟，你的手机，电视及电视盒子，遥控器，你的烤箱，你的手表，你的汽车，上班的火车，星巴克的收银机，星巴克的咖啡机，你乘坐的电梯，等等。
几乎涉及我们日常生活的每一个方面，我们文明的几乎每一个角落都以某种方式被软件所触及、控制、管理或影响。

Think about that again. Virtually every aspect of our lives has a software component; and yet we exert absolutely no regulatory control over that writing of that software. 
Any Harry Hacker with a “J” in his name can get hired to write Java code. And the strongest likelihood is that Harry J. 
Hacker’s code be crap, will be wrong, and will not be explicitly tested before it is shipped.

再想想。事实上，我们生活的方方面面都有一个软件组件；然而，我们绝对没有对软件的编写施加任何监管控制。
任何名为“J”的Harry黑客都可以被雇佣来编写Java代码。而最有可能的是哈里·J。
黑客的代码是垃圾，将会是错误的，并且在发布之前不会被明确测试。

Plumbers are regulated. Electricians are regulated. Architects, lawyers, and doctors are regulated. 
Why aren’t we? Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want government to be the regulator; I want us to self-regulate. 
But if we software developers don’t figure out how to do that, then government will certainly step in. And then life will get really bad.

水管工被监管。电工被监管。建筑师、律师、医生被监管。
我们为什么不能？不要误会我们，我并不希望政府成为我们的监管者；我希望我们自我监管。
但如果我们软件开发者不知道如何做到这一点，政府一定会介入。那样的话，情况将变得非常糟糕。

Yesterday I received a very scary, letter that underscores this point rather dramatically. I thought you’d like to read it. 
I worked with the developer to sanitize it so that the innocent people in this story are not punished. 
I regret that I can’t splash the guilty parties’ names all over twitter though.

昨天我收到了一封非常可怕的信，它戏剧性地强调了这一点。我想你会想看看的。
我和开发者一起清理了它，这样故事中无辜的人就不会受到惩罚。
但我很遗憾，我不能在twitter上到处散播有罪一方的名字。

Hello “Uncle Bob”,

你好，“Bob 大叔”，

I’m a 34 year old freelance programmer who has been developing software for 15 years.

我是一个34岁的自由程序员已经开发了15年的软件了。

Some time ago I was hired as a team leader for a safety critical embedded system that controlled a medical surgery device. 
Everything was fine during the first months. 
I put a great deal of architectural effort into safety. 
I used Active-Objects for safer threading, UML-Generated State-Machines for stateful safety-checks, simulation, and lots of Unit-Testing (though not with full coverage).

不久前，我被聘为一个安全关键嵌入式系统的组长，该系统控制着一个医疗手术设备。
头几个月一切都很好。
我在安全方面投入了大量的架构工作。
我使用Active-Objects来实现更安全的线程，使用uml生成的状态机来进行状态安全检查、模拟和大量的单元测试(尽管没有完全覆盖)。

Oh, things weren’t perfect. We had been asked to finish a four year project in less than 1 year; so time pressure was very high. 
Even so I had a good feeling that the device would be safe for millions of treatments.

哦，事情并不完美。我们被要求用少于1年的时间完成一个四年的项目；因此时间压力非常高。
即便如此，我还是有一种良好的感觉，这种设备对于数百万的治疗来说是安全的。

Eventually it became clear that we could not deliver the full release on time. 
When we told our manager, he began to worry about his bonus. (At least that’s my personal suspicion). 
When I told him we couldn’t meet the schedule, he told me I was not allowed to make any more estimates. 
He shouted a lot all day long and forced everyone to work 7 days a week. 
He was in such a rage that he even scared the validation team into concluding the official medical validation after just a few days; which was far too early.

最终结果很明显，我们无法按时交付完整的版本。
当我们告诉我们的精力，他开始担忧他的奖金。（至少那是我个人的怀疑）。
当我告诉他我们不能完成计划时，他告诉我不允许我再做任何估计。
他整天大喊大叫，强迫每个人一周工作7天。
他非常愤怒，甚至吓得验证团队在几天后就完成了正式的医学验证;这还太早了。

He knew that safety was the most important issue for me, so he began to cut my responsibilities. 
He eventually gave full control of the project to the youngest and most impressionable programmer on my team. 
I continued to code in the main-branch of the project; so the manager made his own code branch and, together with the rookie, produced his own version of the software.

他知道安全对我来说是最重要的，所以他开始削减我的责任。
他最终将项目的全部控制权交给了团队中最年轻、最易受影响的程序员。
我继续在项目的主分支中编写代码;因此，经理创建了自己的代码分支，并与菜鸟一起开发了自己的软件版本。

So I terminated my contract with the company.

所以我终止了和公司的合同。

A few days later the first bug occurred during a human trial. 
Fortunately, during the early days of the project, I had made the software robust enough that the bug didn’t harm the patient. 
The device just stopped operating before starting the automated surgery. 
You’d think that would have been a wakeup call, but the company didn’t even analyze the bug (not to mention stopping the unstable product). 
More bugs were found later. Even obvious bugs like mixing up the surgery directions (upwards/downwards) were found during the first human treatments. 
It is a real possibility, and one of my great fears, that tomorrow some patient will become severely disabled.

几天后，第一个漏洞在人体试验中出现。
幸运的是，在项目的早期，我已经使软件足够健壮，bug不会伤害到患者。
在开始自动手术之前，设备就停止了工作。
你可能会认为这是一个警钟，但该公司甚至没有分析漏洞(更不用说停止不稳定的产品)。
后来又发现了更多的bug。甚至像混淆手术方向(向上/向下)这样明显的错误也在人类第一次治疗中被发现。
这是一种真实的可能性，也是我最大的恐惧之一，明天一些病人将会变得严重残疾。

The other programmers didn’t quit. 
They told me: “the boss is the boss – we just do what he tells us – it’s his responsibility.”. 
So I figured I must have been crazy for quitting. I felt weak and worthless, like I couldn’t handle the pressure. But lately I started reading “Clean Coder”. 
And it’s made me consider that, perhaps, I’m not weak – but the opposite: strong.

其他程序员没有退出。
他们告诉我:“老板就是老板——我们只要按他说的做——这是他的责任。”
所以我想我戒烟一定是疯了。我觉得自己软弱无能，无法承受这种压力。但最近我开始读《干净的程序员》。
这让我意识到，也许我并不软弱，恰恰相反，我很坚强。

I am, of course, furious about the manager who drove his organization to such unprofessional depths. 
He is an idiot and a criminal, and I hope he winds up in prison. But I am even angrier at the developers. 
Not only were they accomplices to that criminal idiocy; they made the one guy who took a stand feel stupid and weak. 
They are the ones who are stupid and weak. They should not be programmers. Programmers are better than that.

当然，我对那个把他的公司逼到如此不专业境地的经理感到愤怒。
他是个白痴，是个罪犯，我希望他最后能进监狱。但我更生气的是开发者。
他们不仅是那种愚蠢的犯罪行为的帮凶;他们让唯一坚持立场的人觉得自己又蠢又弱。
他们才是愚蠢和软弱的人。他们不应该是程序员。程序员比这要好。

Aren’t we?

我们不是吗？
