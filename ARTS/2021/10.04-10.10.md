## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
102. 二叉树的层序遍历
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给你一个二叉树，请你返回其按 层序遍历 得到的节点值。 （即逐层地，从左到右访问所有节点）。

 

示例：
二叉树：[3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
返回其层序遍历结果：

[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]

```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
type TreeNode struct {
	Val   int
	Left  *TreeNode
	Right *TreeNode
}

func levelOrder(root *TreeNode) [][]int {
	var height = 1
	var result = make([][]int, 0)
	return render(root, height, result)
}

func render(node *TreeNode, height int, result [][]int) [][]int {
	if node == nil {
		return result
	}
	if len(result) < height {
		result = append(result, []int{})
	}
	result[height-1] = append(result[height-1], node.Val)
	result = render(node.Left, height+1, result)
	result = render(node.Right, height+1, result)
	return result
}

func bfs(root *TreeNode) [][]int {
	var result = make([][]int, 0)
	if root == nil {
		return result
	}
	var queue = []*TreeNode{root}
	for len(queue) > 0 {
		var tmp []*TreeNode
		var ret []int
		for i := 0; i < len(queue); i++ {
			ret = append(ret, queue[i].Val)
			if queue[i].Left != nil {
				tmp = append(tmp, queue[i].Left)
			}
			if queue[i].Right != nil {
				tmp = append(tmp, queue[i].Right)
			}
		}
		result = append(result, ret)
		queue = tmp
	}
	return result
}
```
### 4. 说明
采用了两种方式：
    * 第一种是深度优先遍历，递归给result数组赋值；
    * 第二种是广度优先遍历，采用先进先出队列按层给result数组赋值；

Code Hoarders

代码囤积者

Have you ever watched an episode of Hoarders, or a documentary about a hoarder? Shows like this were popular a few years back. 
They showcased the tragic, and all-too-common, phenomenon of people who have lost control over their living space by filling it with so much junk that there’s no place for them to live.

你有没有观看一集《囤积者》，或者一部关于囤积者的影片？这类影片过去几年很流行。
他们展示了悲剧，和现实生活，一种现象，人们已经失去了对他们的生活空间的控制，装满了太多的垃圾，没有地方住。

These people fill their homes so full of stuff that all they have left are dark and narrow passageways winding through floor to ceiling towers of junk, trash, old food, pet droppings, dirty laundry, and other less mentionable things. 
The volume of each room is taken up by junk. The counters, the tables, and the furniture are invisible, buried, beneath junk. The bedrooms and bathrooms are piled high. 
There is no room to move. No room to eat. No room to sleep. No room to live. There have been cases in which dead bodies have been found beneath the piles of rubbish and detritus.

这些人把家里填满了东西（破烂，垃圾，旧食物，宠物粪便，脏衣服，和一些不值一提的东西），从地板蜿蜒到天花板只剩下黑暗、狭窄的通道。
每间屋子的空间都被垃圾占据。柜台、桌子和家具都被埋在垃圾堆下面，看不见。浴室卧室堆得很高。
没有移动的空间。没有地方吃饭。没有地方睡觉。没有地方住。在一些案例中，在成堆的垃圾和碎石下发现了尸体。

And yet, every day, these pitiful hoarders bring another new load of junk into their homes. 
And they pile it on top of the towers of older junk. Sometimes those towers wiggle and wobble, and then fall – blocking the narrow paths that have been carved through the mountains of trash.

然而，每一天，这些囤积者把一些新的垃圾带到他们的家里。
然后把它堆在旧垃圾堆成的塔上。有时候这塔会摇摆不定，然后掉下来，堵住了垃圾堆里凿出来的狭窄小路。

Google for “Hoarders” if you’ve never seen one of these shows; and be prepared to be disgusted.

Google搜索“Hoarders”如果你从未看过这些节目；那么准备好被恶心吧。

If you have watched a show like this, then perhaps you have wondered how anyone could live like that – how anyone could choose to live like that. 
But think about it. It’s not that hard to understand. It’s easy to rationalize that the “stuff” you are bringing into your house is adding value to your life. 
After all, it’s new stuff. New clothes. New appliances. New furniture. New books. It’s property! And property has value. So it’s easy to think: “The more stuff, the better.”

如果你看过这样的节目，那么你可能会想，怎么会有人这样生活——怎么会有人选择这样生活。
但仔细想想。这并不难理解。人们很容易找到理由，认为你带回家的“东西”给你的生活增加了价值。
毕竟，这是新事物。新衣服。新家电。新家具。新书。它的财产!财产是有价值的。所以人们很容易认为:“东西越多越好。”

It’s also easy to believe that acquiring new stuff is more important than organizing old stuff. 
After all, organizing old stuff does not add value. It’s acquiring new stuff that counts. 
So if there’s any spare time, or spare effort, or spare energy, it should be directed towards acquiring new stuff. 
Organizing the old stuff is a waste.

人们也很容易相信，获取新东西比整理旧东西更重要。
毕竟，整理旧东西不会增加价值。重要的是获得新的东西。
所以，如果你有多余的时间、精力或精力，就应该把它们用在学习新东西上。
整理旧东西是一种浪费。

Finally, once the mess starts to grow, it’s easy to rationalize away any hope that it can be cleaned. 
You quickly conclude that there’s no point in cleaning anything because a day’s effort, a week’s effort, even a month’s effort wouldn’t make a dent. 
To quote Dr. Seuss from The Cat in the Hat: “…this mess is so big, And so deep and so tall, We cannot pick it up. There is no way at all!”

最后，一旦混乱开始加剧，很容易找借口打消它能被打扫干净的希望。
你很快就得出结论说，没有必要清理任何东西，因为一天的努力，一周的努力，甚至一个月的努力都无济于事。
引用苏斯博士在《戴帽子的猫》里的话:“……这个烂摊子太大，太深，太高，我们捡不起来。”根本没有办法!”

Code

代码

Now of course you realize that I’m talking about code. 
I’m suggesting that the mentality that creates crufty tangled systems is the mentality of a hoarder. 
I’m also suggesting that the result is the same: an unhealthy, unworkable, and unlivable environment. 
But let’s walk step by step through the reasoning.

你当然知道我说的是代码。
我的意思是，创造混乱混乱系统的心态是囤积者的心态。
我还认为结果是一样的:一个不健康、不可行、不适宜居住的环境。
但让我们一步一步地推理。

Have you ever been a Code Hoarder? Have you ever worked on a project that was built by Code Hoarders? 
Do you wander through dark passageways of floor to ceiling cruft as you attempt to add some new feature or fix some old bug? 
Do the towers of junk wiggle and wobble and threaten to fall and block your path? Are there whole rooms of code that you dare not visit? 
Is the structure of the system invisible and buried under piles of new features and dead code?

你曾经是代码囤积者吗?您曾经参与过由代码囤积者构建的项目吗?
当你试图添加一些新功能或修复一些旧bug时，你是否徘徊在地板到天花板的黑暗通道中?
垃圾塔摇摆不定，威胁着要倒下，挡住你的路吗?是不是有整间密室你都不敢去看?
系统的结构是不可见的，并且被埋在成堆的新特性和死代码之下吗?

Do you believe that adding value means adding new features. Do you believe that acquiring new features is more important than organizing old features? 
Do you believe that effort applied to cleaning up the old system is wasted effort? 
Have you given up on any effort of cleaning because you know that you don’t have the time to make a dent in the mess? 
If you have, you are a Code Hoarder; and your work life is a deep and overwhelming mess.

你认为增加价值意味着增加新功能吗?你是否认为获取新功能比组织旧功能更重要?
你是否认为花在清理旧系统上的努力是徒劳的?
你是否曾因为知道自己没有时间去收拾残局而放弃了打扫的努力?
如果你有，你是代码囤积者;你的工作生活是一个深深的和压倒性的混乱。

We have a name for the result. We call it Legacy Code. The very term fills us with disgust and despair.

我们为结果取了一个名字。我们称之为遗留代码。这个词让我们感到厌恶和绝望。

Legacies

遗产

Who gets to clean up that horrific mess when the Hoarders die? Who hires the garbage trucks to haul away the hundreds of tons of junk? 
Who hires the HAZMAT team to disfinfect the home? Who hires the cleanup crew to scrub and wash, and paint, and repair the home? 
The children, of course. Or if not the Children, then the Community. The legacy that a Hoarder leaves is a legacy of junk, trash, filth, and the huge effort required to get it all cleaned up. 
The legacy of a Hoarder gets worse and worse so long as the Hoarder is alive.

储物症患者死后，谁来收拾这烂摊子?谁雇垃圾车拖走几百吨垃圾?
谁雇了危险品处理小组来消毒房子?谁雇了清洁工来擦洗、清洗、油漆和修理房子?
当然是孩子们。如果不是孩子，那就是社区。囤积者留下的遗产是一堆垃圾、垃圾和污秽，需要付出巨大的努力才能清理干净。
只要储物症患者还活着，他留下的遗产就会越来越糟。

But legacies don’t have to be that way. Indeed, most people strive to leave a legacy of improvement. 
Most people want to leave something behind that makes life better for those who follow. 
Indeed, it is the work of most people’s lives to continuously improve their legacy.

但遗产并不一定是这样的。事实上，大多数人都努力留下改进的遗产。
大多数人都想留下一些东西，让身后的人生活得更好。
事实上，不断改善自己的遗产是大多数人一生的工作。

A true legacy gets better with age.

真正的遗产会随着时间的推移而变得更好。

Better with Age?

随着年纪变得更好?

And isn’t that what humans do? Don’t humans make things better with time? 
If you’ve got an old car in the garage that you are refurbishing, don’t you expect that car to get better and better and better with each passing day? 
If you are painting a picture, don’t you expect that picture to get better and better with age?

人类不就是这么做的吗?人类不是随着时间的推移而变得更好吗?
如果你在车库里有一辆旧车，你正在翻新，难道你不希望那辆车一天比一天好吗?
如果你正在画一幅画，难道你不希望画得越老越好吗?

Can you imagine hiring an artist, a mechanic, an engineer, a doctor, a lawyer, or anyone else, whose work products get worse the longer they work on them? 
How can making things worse, day after day, be the behavior of a professional? How can it be the behavior of a programmer?

你能想象雇佣一个美工、机械师、工程师、医生、律师或其他人，他们的工作产品越久越差吗?
日复一日，专业人士的行为怎么会让事情变得更糟呢?这怎么可能是程序员的行为呢?

A professional team of programmers make their code better each day. The quality of the code improves with time. That’s how you know they are professionals. 
Professionals make things better with time. The Legacy code left by professionals will be cleaner and cleaner the older it is because it has enjoyed the long attention of those professionals.

一个专业的程序员团队每天都在改进他们的代码。代码的质量会随着时间的推移而提高。这样你就知道他们是专业人士了。
专业人士会随着时间的推移做得更好。专业人士留下的遗留代码越老越干净，因为它已经得到了这些专业人士的长期关注。

Do you make the code better each day? Or does each day leave the code a little bit worse than the day before?

你是否每天都在改进代码?还是每天的代码都比前一天差一点?

Is your work leaving a legacy of value, or are you just building a monstrous hoard for someone else to clean up?

你的工作是否留下了有价值的遗产，或者你只是在建立一个巨大的宝藏，让别人去清理?

### 3. 点评
Bob大叔以“囤积者”作为例子，引申出“代码囤积者”的概念，通过对比，非常形象的反应了软件这个行业的现状，很多人都有囤积代码的习惯，最后导致代码不可维护，系统随时都可能崩溃的风险。
