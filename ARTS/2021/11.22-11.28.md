## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
136. 只出现一次的数字
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给定一个非空整数数组，除了某个元素只出现一次以外，其余每个元素均出现两次。找出那个只出现了一次的元素。

说明：

你的算法应该具有线性时间复杂度。 你可以不使用额外空间来实现吗？

示例 1:

输入: [2,2,1]
输出: 1
示例 2:

输入: [4,1,2,1,2]
输出: 4
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func singleNumber(nums []int) int {
	var single int
	for _, v := range nums {
		single ^= v
	}
	return single
}
```
### 4. 说明
* 任何数和 00 做异或运算，结果仍然是原来的数，即 a ^ 0 = a。
* 任何数和其自身做异或运算，结果是 00，即 a ^ a = 0。
* 异或运算满足交换律和结合律，即 a ^ b ^ a = b ^ a ^ a = b ^ (a ^ a) = b ^ 0 = b。

Professionalism and TDD (Reprise)

专业性和TDD（重复）

Lately I have been criticized, both directly and indirectly, for associating TDD with professionalism. 
Indeed, I believe much of the recent “true believer” rhetoric we have been subjected to comes from that association.

最近，我因为将TDD与专业性联系在一起而受到了直接或间接的批评。
事实上，我相信，我们最近听到的“真正的信徒”的说法大多来自于这种联系。

I plead guilty to claiming that the association exists. 
I wrote extensively about it in the article Professionalism and Test-Driven-Development, IEEE Software, 06/2007

我承认这种联系的存在。
我在《专业主义和测试驱动开发》这篇文章中对它进行了广泛的讨论，IEEE软件，2006 /2007

Now, let me preface this by saying that there are a number of programmers whom I respect and honor who either do not practice TDD or do not consider it to be associated with professionalism.
Jim Coplien (Cope), Rich Hickey, and David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) to name a few.

现在，让我先说一下，我尊敬的许多程序员要么不实践TDD，要么不认为它与专业性有关。
比如，吉姆•科普林(Cope)、里奇•希基(Rich Hickey)和戴维•海涅迈尔•汉森(David Heinemeier Hansson)。

As I have said many times before, Cope is a hero of mine. His writings in the 90s and since have had a huge impact on my way of thinking and my career.
Rich Hickey is the author of Clojure, and someone with whom I have had several discussions back in the 90s, when he was a C++ programmer. 
I currently use Clojure as my primary language, and I try to read as much of Hickey’s writings, and listen to as many of his talks, as I can.
DHH is the author of Rails; a framework that has done more for the Ruby community, the web community, and the whole software industry than any other I can think of. 
His influence on me, and on the industry is incalculable.
These are good, solid, honorable, professional programmers. I use their work. I trust their integrity. I am privileged to have met and learned so much from them. 
They’ve proven their professionalism. They don’t need me to ratify it for them.

正如我以前多次说过的，柯普是我心目中的英雄。他在90年代及其以后的著作对我的思维方式和职业生涯产生了巨大的影响。
Rich Hickey是Clojure的作者，我在90年代曾与他进行过几次讨论，当时他还是一名c++程序员。
我目前使用Clojure作为我的主要语言，我尽可能多地阅读Hickey的作品，尽可能多地听他的演讲。
DHH是Rails的作者;这个框架为Ruby社区、网络社区和整个软件行业所做的贡献比我能想到的任何其他框架都要多。
他对我和整个行业的影响是无法估量的。
他们都是优秀的、可靠的、可敬的、专业的程序员。我用他们的作品。我相信他们的正直。我很荣幸能遇见他们，并从他们身上学到很多。
他们已经证明了自己的专业性。他们不需要我来批准。

So how can I believe that TDD is associated with professionalism when there are professional programmers, whom I hold in high regard, who don’t agree with that association?

那么，当我非常重视的专业程序员不同意这种关联时，我怎么能相信TDD与专业性相关联呢?

First of all, if you read that article from 2007, you’ll see that I don’t believe that TDD is a prerequisite to professionalism. 
What I believe is that it currently plays a significant role in professional behavior. I also believe it will play a much greater role as we look into the future.

首先，如果你阅读了2007年的那篇文章，你会发现我并不认为TDD是专业的先决条件。
我所相信的是，它目前在职业行为中扮演着重要的角色。我也相信，在我们展望未来时，它将发挥更大的作用。

In that article I briefly referred to the story of Ignaz Semmelweis who in 1847 achieved a six-fold drop in his maternity ward’s mortality rate by simply having doctors wash their hands before examining pregnant women. 
Semmelwies tried to convince his peers to adopt hand-washing as a discipline. They resisted – for over 60 years. The reasons for their resistance sound much like the articles we’ve seen of late claiming that TDD is dead.

在那篇文章中，我简要地提到了Ignaz Semmelweis的故事，他在1847年仅仅通过让医生在检查孕妇前洗手，他的产房死亡率就下降了6倍。
Semmelwies试图说服他的同学们把洗手作为一项纪律。他们反抗了60多年。他们抵制的原因听起来很像我们最近看到的声称TDD已死的文章。

Doctors at that time did not wash their hands. They saw no reason to wash their hands. To them, cleanliness and disease were utterly unrelated. 
To us, in the 21st century, that’s difficult to believe; but just 167 years ago it was just as hard to believe that washing hands was anything but a fools errand.

当时的医生不洗手。他们觉得没有必要洗手。对他们来说，清洁和疾病是毫不相干的。
对21世纪的我们来说，这很难相信;但就在167年前，人们同样难以相信洗手不是一件愚蠢的差事。

Were these doctors unprofessional? Of course not! They were doing the best they could with what they knew. 
Their distrust of Semmelweis seems unreasonable now, because Semmelweis was right. But it’s hard to fault those doctors for not following every fool fad that came along. 
It took time, and unfortunately it took a lot of misery and death, before hand-washing was adopted as a medical discipline.

这些医生不专业吗？当然不是!他们正在用他们所知道的做到最好。
现在看来，他们对Semmelweis的不信任似乎毫无道理，因为Semmelweis是对的。但我们很难指责这些医生没有追随每一个愚蠢的潮流。
这需要时间，不幸的是，在经历了很多痛苦和死亡之后，洗手才被采纳为一门医学学科。

If any doctors today failed to wash their hands, we’d call them unprofessional and drum them out of the profession. 
Such actions would be intolerable. But back then, those doctors who rejected Semmelweis where honorable, respectable, and professional. They weren’t evil. 
They weren’t even stupid. Their only fault was that they were human.

如果今天有医生不洗手，我们会说他们不专业，把他们赶出这个行业。
这种行为是不能容忍的。但那时候，那些拒绝赛梅维的医生是可敬的，可敬的，专业的。他们不是邪恶的。
他们甚至都不笨。他们唯一的缺点就是他们是人类。

Now I realize that I’m casting myself in the role of Ignaz Semmelweis. 
It is not my intention to claim such iconic status. After all, I may be dead wrong. 
TDD may not be the equivalent of hand-washing, no matter how much I think it is. 
If that is the case, then Uncle Bob’s writings and preaching on the topic will fade into a humorous footnote in the history of software. 
A footnote that will be deleted after a decade or so. If that is the case, so be it.

现在我意识到我要扮演的角色是伊格纳兹·赛梅尔维斯。
我并不想拥有这样的标志性地位。毕竟，我可能大错特错了。
TDD可能并不等同于洗手，不管我怎么想。
如果是这样的话，那么Bob大叔关于这个主题的文章和布道将会成为软件历史上一个幽默的脚注。
一个脚注将在大约十年后被删除。如果是这样，那就这样吧。

But patients are dying out there! Healthcare.gov. Knight Capital. Toyota. 
The list goes on; and the casualties are mounting at an accelerating rate. 
Our society as a whole is becoming more and more dependent on the software we produce; and the failures grow in significance with every passing year.

但是那里的病人都快死了!Healthcare.gov。骑士资本。丰田。
这样的例子不胜枚举;伤亡人数正在加速增加。
我们的社会作为一个整体变得越来越依赖于我们生产的软件;随着时间的流逝，失败的重要性与日俱增。

Something must change … or we are headed for a catastrophe of existential magnitude.

必须有所改变，否则我们将面临一场关乎生死存亡的大灾难。

If I am right… If TDD is as significant to software as hand-washing was to medicine and is instrumental in pulling us back from the brink of that looming catastrophe, then Kent Beck will be hailed a hero, and TDD will carry the full weight of professionalism. 
After that, those who refuse to practice TDD will be excused from the ranks of professional programmers. 
It would not surprise me if, one day, TDD had the force of law behind it.

如果我是对的，如果TDD对于软件的重要性就像洗手对于医学的重要性一样，并且能够帮助我们从灾难的边缘拉回来，那么Kent Beck将会被誉为英雄，而TDD将会承载全部的专业精神。
在那之后，那些拒绝实践TDD的人将从专业程序员的行列中被免除。
如果有一天TDD有了法律的支持，我也不会感到惊讶。

Now, you may disagree with me about TDD. That’s fine, and I’m willing to have the debate with you. 
But I won’t call you unprofessional, and I won’t think you are unprofessional. Because today, at this moment in our history, TDD is not the prerequisite of professionalism that I believe it will become.

现在，你可能不同意我对TDD的看法。没关系，我很乐意和你辩论。
但我不会说你不专业，我也不会认为你不专业。因为在今天，在我们历史的这个时刻，TDD并不是我认为它会成为专业的先决条件。

### 3. 点评
Bob大叔阐明了他关于TDD与专业性的观点，他认为TDD并不是专业的先决条件，他希望TDD能够像医生洗手那样重要。
