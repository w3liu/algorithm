The True Corruption of Agile

敏捷真正的缺陷

Andrew Binstock recently wrote a blog entitled The Corruption of Agile, which built upon another blog by Allen Holub entitled The Agile Holocracy. 
Allow me to summarize:

Andrew Binstock最近写了一篇名为“敏捷的堕落”的博客，它建立在Allen Holub的另一个名为“敏捷全息主义”的博客上。
请允许我总结一下:

Holub says:

Holub说:

“…agile is a culture, not a set of practices…”

“……敏捷是一种文化，而不是一套实践……”

Binstock amplifies:

Binstock放大:

“Whether a site is Agile or not depends on its culture. Does the culture support the personal values of the manifesto? 
If so, it’s Agile, if not, then it’s doing something else. So, indeed you could have a fully Agile site without TDD, continuous integration, or scrum. 
Likewise, you can have a site that uses all three practices, but cannot adapt to changes and is wholly inflexible in its work — so, not at all Agile.”

“一个网站是否敏捷取决于它的文化。文化是否支持宣言的个人价值观?
如果是，那就是敏捷，如果不是，那就是在做别的事情。因此，你确实可以有一个完全敏捷的站点，没有TDD、持续集成或scrum。
同样，您可以拥有一个使用了所有三种实践的站点，但是不能适应变化，并且在工作中完全不灵活——因此，根本不是敏捷的。”

At first blush these statements seem reasonable. 
After all, a culture is an expression of values. 
However, Holub’s and Binstock’s statements carry with them the implication that culture and practice are separate. 
They are not. Indeed, culture is defined by practice.

乍一看，这些说法似乎合情合理。
毕竟，文化是价值的表达。
然而，Holub和Binstock的陈述带有文化和实践是分离的暗示。
他们不是。事实上，文化是由实践来定义的。

You know the culture you are in by observing the practices of the people around you. 
If you see a woman in a burka, you can guess her culture. 
If you see a bride and groom breaking a glass under a canopy, you can guess the culture. 
If you see a batch of children swinging a stick at a paper mache donkey hanging from a tree, you can guess the culture.

你可以通过观察周围人的行为来了解你所处的文化。
如果你看到一个穿长袍的女人，你就能猜出她的文化。
如果你看到新娘和新郎在天篷下打碎玻璃，你就能猜到他们的文化。
如果你看到一群孩子拿着棍子朝挂在树上的纸制驴子挥舞，你就能猜到这种文化。

You can’t have a culture without practices; and the practices you follow identify your culture.

没有实践就没有文化;你所遵循的做法体现了你的文化。

Example As an example of this I was once a member of a Jiu Jistsu dojo: Hakko Ryu, the School of the Eight Light. 
We adhered to the practice that, upon entering or leaving the dojo, we would bow to the dojo. 
This was an expression of respect for the place in which we learned, and for the knowledge and skills that we gained. 
If a new student joined, they would quickly observe and emuluate this practice.
No one had to tell them to do it. The practice was contagious.

举个例子，我曾经是一个柔道馆的成员:Hakko Ryu，八光派。
我们坚持在进入或离开道场时，要向道场鞠躬。
这是对我们学习的地方，对我们获得的知识和技能的一种尊重。
如果有新学生加入，他们很快就会观察和效仿这种做法。
没人需要告诉他们去做。这种做法具有传染性。

One day, our Sensei proposed a new practice. 
If you were late to class, instead of simply bowing, you would also drop down and do 10 pushups. 
He asked us if we would accept this new practice. This created an immediate schism. 
The younger folks were all in favor of this new practice because it was an expression of respect for the value of punctuality and also respect for those students who were on time. 
Others of us were opposed because this new practice represented a disrespect for those of us who had complex schedules that made regular punctuality impractical. 
We valued our professions and our marriages above the dojo and did not want that value punished.

有一天，老师提出了一种新的做法。
如果你上课迟到了，你不仅要鞠躬，还得蹲下身子做10个俯卧撑。
他问我们是否愿意接受这种新做法。这造成了直接的分裂。
年轻人都赞成这种新做法，因为这是对守时价值的尊重，也是对那些准时的学生的尊重。
我们中的其他人反对这种做法，因为这种新做法代表了对我们这些日程安排复杂、无法按时到达的人的不尊重。
我们把我们的职业和婚姻看得比道场重要，不希望这种价值受到惩罚。

The Sensei had made his proposal at the end of a class, and asked us how we felt. I blurted out that I was “fundamentally opposed”. 
When asked why, I could not articulate the reason. 
The practice struck at a value that was so deep and intrinsic, I could not find the words. 
Indeed, even though this event happened over fifteen years ago, I only just found the words as I wrote this blog. 
At the time I simply responded by saying I needed more time to  process.

老师在一节课结束时提出了他的建议，并问我们感觉如何。我脱口而出，我“从根本上反对”。
当被问及为什么时，我说不出原因。
这种做法触动了一种如此深刻和内在的价值，我无法用语言来表达。
事实上，即使这件事发生在15年前，我写这篇博客时也只是刚刚找到文字。
当时我只是回答说，我需要更多的时间来消化。

The class ended with no decision. The subsequent scene in the locker room was grim. 
Those of us who didn’t like the proposed rule eyed each other and shook our heads. 
One member even vocalized his frustration by saying “things are changing for the worse around here.”

这堂课没有做出任何决定。随后在更衣室里发生的一幕令人毛骨悚然。
我们当中那些不喜欢提议的规则的人互相看着，摇了摇头。
一名成员甚至表达了他的沮丧，他说:“这里的情况正在变得更糟。”

Fortunately, before this negativity could get out of hand, the Sensei walked into the locker room and said: “Forget I said anything about it. Please act as though the proposal had never been made.” 
This was a very wise move. The negativity and suspicion had not had time to take root, and by the next class it was gone.

幸运的是，在这种消极情绪失控之前，老师走进更衣室说:“忘记我说过的任何事情吧。请表现得好像这个建议从来没有提过似的。”
这是一个非常明智的举动。这种否定和怀疑还没有来得及生根，到下一节课的时候就消失了。

This is an example of how deeply entangled practices are with values and with culture. 
Cultures express their values through their practices. 
It is absurd to imply, as Holub and Binstock do, that practice is irrelevant to culture.

这是实践与价值观和文化紧密相连的一个例子。
文化通过他们的实践表达他们的价值观。
像Holub和Binstock那样暗示实践与文化无关是荒谬的。

Despite Binstock’s assertion, if you find yourself in a team who practice continuous integration, 
short iterations, pair programming, and test driven development, it is a powerful indication you are in a team who shares the values of the agile manifesto. 
If they did not share those values, they would not follow those practices.

尽管Binstock断言，如果您发现自己在一个实践持续集成的团队中，
短迭代、结对编程和测试驱动开发，这是一个强有力的信号，表明您所在的团队共享敏捷宣言的价值。
如果他们不认同这些价值观，他们就不会遵循这些做法。

Ritualism Of course it’s possible for a team to be so entrenched in practice that, over time, they forget the values expressed by those practices. 
This is a common failing of bureaucracies and religions. They become so strongly defined by their practices, that the practices become rituals, the original values are forgotten, and the rituals become the values.

当然，团队在实践中太过根深蒂固是有可能的，随着时间的推移，他们会忘记那些实践所表达的价值。
这是官僚机构和宗教的共同缺点。它们被实践定义得如此强烈，以至于实践变成了仪式，最初的价值观被遗忘了，仪式变成了价值观。

The fear of ritualism is appropriate. In 1999, when Kent Beck and I decided to put our energies into the promotion of Extreme Programming, we feared that we could be starting a religion instead of a movement, 
and vowed to fight ritualism when it arose. This concern and vow was expressed again in the 2001 meeting that produced the Agile Manifesto.

对仪式的恐惧是恰当的。1999年，当Kent Beck和我决定将我们的精力投入到推广极限编程时，我们担心我们可能会开始一种宗教而不是一场运动，
并发誓要在仪式兴起时与之斗争。这种关注和誓言在产生敏捷宣言的2001年会议上再次得到了表达。

But in the years since, ritualism has not been the problem. 
We don’t see lots of people ritualistically practicing pair programming, test driven development, small releases, on-site customer, etc. 
We do see people adopting these practices out of enthusiasm. 
But enthusiasm should not be mistaken for religion or ritualism. 
Enthusiasm implies a change to the status quo; ritualism implies the exact opposite.

但从那以后，仪式就不再是问题了。
我们并没有看到很多人习惯性地练习结对编程、测试驱动开发、小型发布、现场客户等等。
我们确实看到人们出于热情而采用这些做法。
但热情不应被误认为是宗教或仪式。
热情意味着改变现状;仪式的含义正好相反。

Perhaps it was the fear of ritualism that motivated Holub and Binstock to suggest the separation of practice from culture. 
Perhaps they fear that the emphasis upon practice is necessarily a deemphasis of value. 
But this is entirely incorrect. The current enthusiasm for TDD, for example, is a very deep expression of value.

也许正是对仪式主义的恐惧促使Holub和Binstock提出将实践与文化分离。
也许他们担心对实践的强调必然是对价值的贬低。
但这是完全错误的。例如，当前对TDD的热情是一种非常深刻的价值表达。

In any case, if you separate the practices from a culture, as Holub and Binstock suggest, then you corrupt the culture. 
You simply cannot have a culture devoid of practice.

无论如何，如果你像Holub和Binstock建议的那样，将实践与文化分离开来，那么你就会破坏文化。
你不能有一个缺乏实践的文化。

TDD I raised the specter of TDD because Binstock railed against it rather loudly in his blog. For example:

我之所以提到TDD，是因为Binstock在他的博客中强烈反对它。例如：

“It will pain some readers to know that the vast, error-free Internet predates Agile and even predates TDD. Crazy, right?”

“许多读者会痛苦地发现，广阔无错的互联网早于敏捷，甚至早于TDD。疯狂的,对吗?”

And again:

再说一遍：

“When I speak with adherents of test-driven development (TDD) in particular, there is a seeming non-comprehension that truly excellent, reliable code was ever developed prior to the advent of this one practice. 
I sense their view that the long history of code that put man on the moon, ran phone switches, airline reservation systems, and electric grids was all the result of luck or unique talents, rather than the a function of careful discipline and development rigor.”

“特别是当我与测试驱动开发(TDD)的拥护者交谈时，他们似乎不理解在这种实践出现之前曾经开发过真正优秀、可靠的代码。
我能感受到他们的观点，即把人类送上月球、运行电话交换机、航空预订系统和电网的漫长代码历史，都是运气或独特才能的结果，而不是严格的纪律和严格的开发的功能。”

These rather snide complaints are disappointing. 

这些相当刻薄的抱怨令人失望。

Is a practice like TDD, or the enthusiasm for that practice, so threatening that it should be answered with derision?

像TDD这样的实践，或者对这种实践的热情，是否如此具有威胁性，以至于它应该被嘲笑?

Of course good software was built before TDD. Good software is being built today without TDD. So What? Those facts imply nothing at all about the effectiveness of TDD. 
After all, many doctors saved lives before the practice of sterile procedure, and many accountants managed to keep reasonable accounts before the practice of double entry bookkeeping. 
So what? Past success does not imply the ineffectiveness of new practices; nor does past success imply that the enthusiasm for new practices is inappropriate.

当然，好的软件是在TDD之前构建的。今天，在没有TDD的情况下，优秀的软件正在被构建。那又怎样?这些事实完全没有暗示TDD的有效性。
毕竟，许多医生在实施无菌手术之前就挽救了生命，在采用复式记账法之前，许多会计人员都能保持合理的账目。
那又怎样?过去的成功并不意味着新做法的无效;过去的成功也并不意味着对新做法的热情是不恰当的。

The Tension of Adoption I understand why people might look at new practices with skepticism. The enthusiastic adoption of a new practice by one group creates tension with others who do not adopt the practice. 
The adopters can make the non-adopters feel slighted and invalidated; as if everything they had ever done in the past was wrong. 
The adopters, in their enthusiasm, may claim that adoption is a new requirement of professionalism. The non-adopters may claim that the adopters are fanatics who are detached from reality and ignorant of the past.

我理解为什么人们会带着怀疑的眼光看待新的实践。一组人热情地采用一种新的实践会造成与其他不采用这种实践的人之间的紧张关系。
采用者会让非采用者感到被轻视和无效;好像他们过去所做的一切都是错的。
在他们的热情中，采用者可能会声称，采用者是一种新的职业要求。非采用者可能会声称采用者是脱离现实、对过去一无所知的狂热者。

Certainly this happened with sterile procedure in medicine. The adopters were derided and dismissed by the medical establishment for sixty years before the adopters eventually outnumbered the non-adopters. 
Doctors at the time did not like to think that they were causing disease by failing to wash their hands. They also expressed their concern about the time such washing procedures would require. 
Then, as now, doctors were busy people. Hand-washing rituals would reduce the number of patients that could be treated.

这在医学无菌程序中确实发生过。这些采用者被医疗机构嘲笑和解雇了60年，直到最终采用者的数量超过了不采用者。
当时的医生不愿意认为他们不洗手会导致疾病。他们还对洗涤程序所需的时间表示担忧。
当时和现在一样，医生都是很忙的人。洗手仪式将减少可以治疗的病人数量。

Double entry bookkeeping had an even more checkered history, being adopted, forgotten, re-adopted, decreed, and ignored, for three centuries. 
The fight to make that practice mainstream was long and difficult.

复式记账法的历史更加曲折，被采用，被遗忘，被重新采用，被规定，被忽视，持续了三个世纪。
让这种做法成为主流的斗争是漫长而艰难的。

Nowadays these practices are ingrained in the cultures of medicine and accounting. 
It is hard to imagine a doctor who fails to scrub before surgery, or an accountant who uses single-entry bookkeeping for corporate accounts.

如今，这些做法在医学和会计文化中根深蒂固。
很难想象一个医生在手术前不洗手，或者一个会计对公司账目使用单一记账法。

The new practices won out over the old ones because the population of those who did not wish to change their practices gradually declined while the population of those who were enthusiastic about the new practices grew. 
The new practices expressed a shift in the values of the cultures that adopted them. Those practices cannot nowadays be separated from those shifted cultures.

新做法战胜了旧做法，因为不希望改变做法的人逐渐减少，而热衷于新做法的人却在增加。
这些新的做法表达了采纳它们的文化价值观的转变。如今，这些做法与那些不断变化的文化密不可分。

The True Corruption of Agile The biggest problem I have seen within the Agile movement is the elimination of the practices. 
One by one, over the years, the practices have been de-emphasized, or even stripped away. 
This loss of practice has diluted and changed the Agile culture into something that I don’t recognize as Agile any more. 
It has been a shift away from excellence towards mediocrity, away from hard realities, towards feel-good platitudes.

我在敏捷运动中看到的最大问题是实践的消失。
多年来，这些做法被一个接一个地淡化了，甚至被剥夺了。
这种实践的缺失已经冲淡并改变了敏捷文化，使我不再认为它是敏捷。
这是一个从卓越到平庸的转变，从严酷的现实到感觉良好的陈词滥调的转变。

It began with the notion that anyone could become a “master” of anything by sitting in a two day class and getting a piece of paper. 
Soon to follow was the dilution and eventual loss of the technical practices. 
This prompted Martin Fowler to publish his classic and definitive blog: Flaccid Scrum. 
Then came the emphasis of project management over craftsmanship and the rise of the soft skills (attitudes) over the hard skills (practices).

它始于这样一种观念，即任何人都可以通过参加为期两天的课程并拿到一张纸而成为任何事情的“大师”。
随之而来的是技术实践的稀释和最终丧失。
这促使Martin Fowler发表了他的经典且权威的博客:Flaccid Scrum。
然后，项目管理的重要性超过了工艺，软技能(态度)超过了硬技能(实践)。

At that 2001 meeting in Snowbird where we wrote the Agile Manifesto, Kent Beck stated one of our goals: “..to heal the divide between development and business.” 
Unfortunately the deemphasis of practices within the Agile movement has only served to widen that divide. 
While project managers have flocked into the Agile movement, developers have fled out of it. The original movement has fractured into two movements. 
The Software Craftsmanship movement has preserved the coupling between practice and culture; whereas the Agile movement has shifted away from it.

在2001年Snowbird会议上，我们写了敏捷宣言，Kent Beck提到了我们的目标之一:“…弥合开发和商业之间的鸿沟。”
不幸的是，在敏捷运动中对实践的淡化只会扩大这种分歧。
当项目经理们涌入敏捷运动时，开发人员已经逃离了它。原来的运动分裂成两个运动。
软件工艺运动保留了实践和文化之间的耦合;然而敏捷运动已经偏离了它。

So, to my mind, the true corruption of Agile is Holub’s statement:

所以，在我看来，敏捷的真正缺陷在于Holub的声明:

“…agile is a culture, not a set of practices…”

“……敏捷是一种文化，而不是一套实践……”

No. Agile is a culture expressed through a set of practices.

不。敏捷是一种通过一系列实践来表达的文化。

Are those practices set in stone? 
Are the original 13 practices of XP the holy writ? 
Are you an apostate if you don’t practice TDD? Of course not. 
But if you don’t use those particular practices, you’d better use some that are as good or better. 
And the practices you use will define your culture and be an expression of your values.

这些做法是一成不变的吗?
XP最初的13种做法是神圣的吗?
如果你不实践TDD，你是叛教者吗?当然不是。
但是如果你不使用这些特定的方法，你最好使用一些同样好的或者更好的方法。
你使用的做法将定义你的文化，并成为你价值观的表达。

If your values are those of the Agile Manifesto, then your practices will likely look a lot like those original 13; 
because to a large degree it was those 13 practices that drove us to write that manifesto.

如果你的价值观是敏捷宣言的价值观，那么你的实践很可能会和最初的13条很相似;
因为在很大程度上，正是这13种做法驱使我们写下了这份宣言。

If you’ve got better practices, I’d love to see them. If I believe they are better, I’ll adopt them in a heartbeat. 
Because, under no circumstances, will I become the doctor who gets in the way of hand-washing.

如果你有更好的做法，我很乐意看到。如果我认为他们更好，我会毫不犹豫地采用他们。
因为，在任何情况下，我都不会成为妨碍洗手的医生。
