## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
85. 最大矩形
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给定一个仅包含 0 和 1 、大小为 rows x cols 的二维二进制矩阵，找出只包含 1 的最大矩形，并返回其面积。

示例 1：
```
[!qr](./images/0913_a_1.jpg)
```

输入：matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
输出：6
解释：最大矩形如上图所示。
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func maximalRectangle(matrix [][]byte) int {
	if len(matrix) == 0 {
		return 0
	}
	var result int
	var heights = make([]int, len(matrix[0]))
	for i := 0; i < len(matrix); i++ {
		for j := 0; j < len(matrix[i]); j++ {
			if matrix[i][j] == '1' {
				heights[j] = heights[j] + 1
			} else {
				heights[j] = 0
			}
		}
		area := largestRectangleArea(heights)
		if area > result {
			result = area
		}
	}
	return result
}

func largestRectangleArea(heights []int) int {
	var n = len(heights)
	var res = 0
	var stack = make([]int, 0)
	var temp = make([]int, n+2, n+2)
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		temp[i+1] = heights[i]
	}
	heights = temp
	for i := 0; i < len(heights); i++ {
		for len(stack) > 0 {
			tail := stack[len(stack)-1]
			if heights[i] < heights[tail] {
				stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
				curI := tail
				curH := heights[curI]
				if len(stack) > 0 {
					tail = stack[len(stack)-1]
					leftI := tail
					rightI := i
					curW := rightI - leftI - 1
					curS := curW * curH
					if curS > res {
						res = curS
					}
				}
			} else {
				break
			}
		}
		stack = append(stack, i)
	}
	return res
}
```
### 4. 说明
1. 上周做过求`柱状图最大面积`的一道题；
2. 本题可以将问题拆分为n个`柱状图最大面积`的子问题题；
3. 定义heights数组，然后遍历每一层，将heights传入`largestRectangleArea`方法，求得最大面积；
4. 与`result`结果比较，最后返回result即可；

A Spectrum of Trust

信任的范围

The response to my two previous blogs: Where’s the Foreman and Oh Foreman Where Art Thou continues to be mixed; 
and has gotten quite loud. That’s a good thing; because we need to have this discussion.

对我之前两个博客的回应:《工头在哪里》和《噢工头，你是谁》仍然是混杂的;
而且声音很大。这是件好事;因为我们得好好谈谈。

The Perfect Agile Team

完美的敏捷团队

At one end of the spectrum of trust within a team is the perfect agile team. 
Such a team is composed of 6-12 experienced developers with good design sense and a deep commitment to craftsmanship. 
They all sit around a single table. They all start and end work at the same time. 
They all pair with each other 100% of the time; changing pair partners several times per day. 
They have an on-site customer who perfectly balances the backlog. Their velocity is consistent and flat from iteration to iteration. 
They all practice TDD perfectly. Their code coverage is 100%. 
They all refactor mercilessly. Their code is clean. They are the perfect agile team.

团队内部信任的一端是完美的敏捷团队。
这样的团队由6-12名经验丰富的开发人员组成，具有良好的设计意识和对工艺的高度承诺。
他们都围着一张桌子坐着。他们都在同一时间开始或结束工作。
他们100%时间都是成对的；每天换几次同伴。
他们有一个现场客户完美的平衡了代办事项。他们的速度从一个迭代到另一个迭代是一致和平缓的。
他们都完美地实践了TDD。他们的代码覆盖率是100%。
它们都毫不留情地进行重构。他们的代码很干净。他们是完美的敏捷团队。

Does this team need a foreman? The question is meaningless because the team is composed of nothing but foremen. 
Everyone on the team is trusted; and every line of code is seen by a trusted pair partner over and over again. 
No single individual needs to take on a special inspection role, because all members are taking that role.

这个团队需要工头吗？这个问题毫无疑问因为这个团队只有工头。
每个人在团队内都是被信任的；每一行代码被一个被信任的同伴反复看到。
没有一个人需要承担一个特殊的检查角色，因为所有的成员都在承担这个角色。

This team also does not need a coach or a scrum master (certified or otherwise). 
The team is perfect. No coaching is necessary. They are all coaches.

这个团队也不需要教练或敏捷教练(认证或其他)。
这个团队是完美的。不需要指导。他们都是教练。

There are likely some teams out there that approach this ideal; 
but in my experience they are few and far between.

可能有一些团队达到了这种理想状态;
但根据我的经验，他们是很少的。

Open-Source Single-Committer

开源单一提交者

At the other end of the trust spectrum is the lone programmer who creates an successful open source project. 
Let’s call her Rachel. Rachel finds herself at the focal point of a community of willing and eager programmers, all grimly determined to be of service to her. 
She is inundated by a steady stream of pull requests and patches. Of course Rachel welcomes the help; but the contributions are all over the map as far as quality is concerned. 
Some of the contributors share her values, and have done a nice job. She has no problem committing their code. Other contributors, however, have done all the wrong things, and have made a mess. 
She can’t have those contributions contaminating her code base.

在信任范围的另一端是独立的程序员，他创建了一个成功的开源项目。
我们就叫她瑞秋吧。瑞秋发现自己处在一个由热心的程序员组成的社区的中心，他们都下定决心要为她服务。
她被源源不断的请求和补丁淹没了。瑞秋当然欢迎帮助;但就质量而言，这些贡献是五花八门的。
一些贡献者分享了她的价值观，并且做得很好。她没有问题提交他们的代码。然而，其他的贡献者却做了所有错误的事情，搞得一团糟。
她不能让那些贡献影响她的代码库。

So Rachel cannot afford to trust all the contributing programmers because they don’t all share her values. 
And so Rachel reviews the pull requests she thinks are important; and only commits those that rise to her values and meet her standards of quality.

所以瑞秋不能信任所有贡献的程序员，因为他们并不都认同她的价值观。
所以瑞秋回顾了她认为重要的拉请求；只提交那些符合她的价值观和符合她的质量标准的东西。

Rachel is the foreman.

瑞秋是工头。

The more success Rachel’s open source project enjoys, the more help she needs managing the backlog, pull requests, and patches. 
To avoid being overwhelmed she chooses a trusted ally from among the most prolific and astute of the contributors. We’ll call her Betty.

瑞秋的开源项目越成功，她就越需要管理代办事项、拉取请求和补丁的帮助。
为了避免被压垮，她从最多产和最精明的贡献者中选择了一个值得信任的盟友。我们叫她贝蒂。

In contribution after contribution Betty has proven that she shares Rachel’s values. 
So Rachel gives Betty commit rights and the two of them work together on the backlog, and on reviewing the stream of contributions from the user community. 
They are now sharing the foreman role.

在一次又一次的捐赠中，贝蒂证明了她与瑞秋的价值观是一致的。
所以瑞秋给了贝蒂提交的权利，他们两个一起工作，一起检查用户社区的贡献流。

Of course this process will continue until the core team of highly trusted individuals rises to a level that can deal with both the backlog and the contributions. 
This core team has shared values and mutual trust. They all act as foremen over the contributions.

当然，这个过程会一直持续下去，直到由高度信任的个人组成的核心团队上升到能够同时处理积压和贡献的水平为止。
这个核心团队有共同的价值观和相互信任。他们都是捐款的领班。

We could view the combination of the core team and the community of contributors as an extended team. 
The trust level in this extended team is low because the contributors don’t necessarily share the values of the core team. 
Rachel, Betty, and the rest of the core team trust each other well enough; but the community at large is another matter. 
In order to maintain the quality of the project, and keep the standards of excellence high, the core team must review each request and reject all those that don’t meet their standards.

我们可以将核心团队和贡献者社区的结合视为一个扩展的团队。
这个扩展团队中的信任水平很低，因为贡献者不一定分享核心团队的价值观。
瑞秋、贝蒂和其他核心团队成员彼此信任;但整个社区就是另一回事了。
为了保持项目的质量，并保持卓越的高标准，核心团队必须审查每个请求，并拒绝所有不符合他们标准的请求。

There are many projects that use a model like this. Junit, FitNesse, NUnit, Linux, git, etc. 
Some of the very best software out there uses this approach. 
Indeed, much of the software revered within the Agile community, was produced, and is maintained, using a foreman model.

有许多项目使用这样的模式。Junit, FitNesse, NUnit, Linux, git等。
一些最好的软件使用这种方法。
事实上，敏捷社区所推崇的许多软件都是使用工头模式生产和维护的。

How do I convince the rest of my team? 
In my travels I encounter many different software teams. Very few are high functioning Agile teams. Most fall pretty low on the trust scale. 
To one extent or another, most of these teams pay lip-service to Agile principles; but do not pair, do not consistently write tests, do not refactor, do not have an on-site customer, etc.. 
They are, in fact, regular old dysfunctional software teams with all the problems you’d expect.

我如何说服我的团队其他成员?
在我的旅行中，我遇到了许多不同的软件团队。很少有高功能的敏捷团队。大多数人的信任度都很低。
在某种程度上，大多数团队口头上都支持敏捷原则;但是不要结对，不要一致地编写测试，不要重构，不要有现场客户等等。
事实上，他们是常规的、老的、功能失调的软件团队，有您所期望的所有问题。

In most cases I encounter these teams because a few members attend a course of mine; or convince their management to bring me in an teach some part of the team. 
I teach them TDD. I teach them Refactoring. I teach them Craftsmanship. I teach them design principles. I teach them professionalism. 
I teach them why it is important to care. I teach them why it is important to never rush. I teach them that the only way to go fast is to go well.

在大多数情况下，我遇到这些团队是因为只有少数人参加了我的课程;或者说服他们的管理层让我在团队里教一些东西。
我教他们TDD。我教他们重构。我教他们工艺。我教他们设计原则。我教他们职业精神。
我教他们为啥关心是重要的。我教他们为什么永远不要着急。我教他们走得快的唯一方法是走得好。

And then, at the end; when I am done teaching and about to leave them, they ask me the most common question I hear :

然后，在最后;当我教完课准备离开他们时，他们问了我最常听到的问题:

How do I convince the rest of my team to do the things you’ve taught?

要怎么说服我的团队其他人去做你教的事情?

And there you go. That’s the same trust issue that Rachel and Betty had, isn’t it? 
The members of the team don’t value the same things; and so they don’t trust each other to write the tests, refactor the code, and keep things clean.

然后就这样。瑞秋和贝蒂也有同样的信任问题，对吧?
团队成员并不看重同样的东西；所以他们不信任对方来编写测试，重构代码，保持整洁。

Enter the Coach Lots of people try to solve this misalignment of values through coaching. 
The team hires a coach, and the coach works with the team, addressing fears, allaying suspicions, guiding, teaching, cajoling, and gradually, softly, moving the team towards trust.

很多人试图通过辅导来解决这种价值观的偏差。
团队雇佣一名教练，教练与团队合作，消除恐惧，消除疑虑，引导，教导，劝诱，逐渐地，温柔地，让团队走向信任。

When this works it is a beautiful thing.

当它成功时，这是一件美好的事情。

It doesn’t work very often. The track record for coaching dysfunctional teams is less than stellar. 
The landscape is littered with some pretty spectacular failures; while the notable successes are few and far between.

它不经常工作。在指导功能失调的团队方面的记录并不出色。
这片土地上充斥着一些相当壮观的失败；然而显著的成功很少。

This is not to say that coaching is a bad idea; it is not. Coaching is a very good idea when the values of the team members are aligned. 
When you have a team that is willing to give it a try; because they truly do value the same things; then a coach can make a huge difference. 
But a coach is not the answer when you have a fundamental disagreement of values inside the team.

这并不是说指导是个坏主意；它不是。当团队成员的价值观一致时，指导是一个非常好的想法。
当你有一个愿意尝试的团队时；因为他们确实看重同样的东西;那么一个教练就会有很大的不同。
但当你在团队内部存在根本的价值观分歧时，教练并不是答案。

That’s why the coaches of sports teams are also foremen. Not only do such coaches teach, guide, advise, and cajole; they also have the power to say “no”. 
A coach, faced with a disagreement of values, must have the power to draw a line in the sand and say: “Only things on this side of the line may pass”.

这就是为什么运动队的教练也是工头。这些教练不仅教导、指导、建议和哄骗；他们也有能力说“不”。
一个教练，面对不同的价值观，必须有能力在沙子上划一条线，并说:“只有线这边的事情可以过去”。

My Answer to That Question. So, at the end of my talks, or courses, when the team members ask me how to convince their other team mates; I tell them this:

我对这个问题的回答。所以，在我的演讲或课程结束时，当团队成员问我如何说服他们的其他团队成员时；我告诉他们：

Most often you can’t convince people to change their behavior. At least not by talking. 
Telling people that they are doing things wrong, and that you know how they should do them right, is not a good way to convince someone. What you can do, is be a role model. 
You can stick to your disciplines and values, and show the others, by example, how to behave. Perhaps one or two others will notice what you are doing, and decide to emulate you.

大多数情况下，你无法说服人们改变他们的行为。至少不是通过谈话。
告诉别人他们做错了，你知道他们应该怎么做对，并不是说服别人的好方法。你能做的，就是做个榜样。
你可以坚持自己的原则和价值观，并向他人展示自己的行为举止。也许有一两个人会注意到你在做什么，并决定效仿你。

And then you’ll have a problem. Because in a team where some follow TDD (for example) and others don’t, the level of conflict will rise until there is a divorce. 
Usually that divorce involves developers leaving the team to find another team that they are more aligned with.

然后你就有麻烦了。因为在一个团队中，一些人遵循TDD(例如)，另一些人不遵循，冲突的程度会上升，直到他们割裂。
通常情况下，这种“割裂”包括开发人员离开团队，去寻找另一个与他们关系更密切的团队。

That period of conflict can be long and painful; and the quality of the software will suffer throughout that period leaving a legacy of troubles.

这段冲突时期可能是漫长而痛苦的；软件的质量在整个过程中都会受到影响，留下一系列的问题。

Foremen If, however, the person asking me that question happens to be someone who has the appropriate responsibility and authority I tell them to look at the open-source model; 
because that model has proven effective in teams that have significant trust issues.

然而，如果问我这个问题的人恰好是有适当责任和权力的人，我会告诉他们看看开源模式;
因为这种模式已经被证明在存在严重信任问题的团队中是有效的。

I tell them to form the people they trust into a core team; 
and give that core team the power to draw a line in the sand, the responsibility to declare standards of quality and behavior, and the authority to enforce those standards. i.e. a team of foremen.

我告诉他们把他们信任的人组成核心团队；
并赋予核心团队划清界限的权力，宣布质量和行为标准的责任，以及执行这些标准的权力。也就是一组工头。

Precipitate the Crisis Several people who read my previous articles have blogged that foremen will cause distrust and destroy the team. 
However, the team I am referring to is already in a state of distrust, and is already on a slow and painful course to destruction. 
The bloggers are right; the foremen will accelerate that. They’ll bring the issue to the fore and precipitate a crisis.

有几个读过我之前文章的人在博客上说，工头会造成不信任并摧毁团队。
然而，我所指的团队已经处于不信任的状态，并且已经在缓慢而痛苦地走向毁灭。
博主们是对的;工头会加快这一进程。他们会把这个问题推到风口浪尖，从而引发一场危机。

And that’s a good thing. I want the crisis to come quickly. I want the period of divisiveness to be short. 
I want those who are going to change to change sooner rather than later. I want those who are going to leave, to leave sooner rather than later. 
I want to get a team with shared values and mutual trust in place as quickly as possible. And while that process is going on, I want the code to be protected by the people I trust.

这是一件好事。我希望危机尽快到来。我希望分裂的时间短一些。
我希望那些将要改变的人尽早改变。我希望那些要离开的人，越早越好。
我希望尽快组建一个拥有共同价值观和相互信任的团队。在这个过程中，我希望我信任的人能保护我的代码。

End Game The goal, of course, is to increase the ranks of the trusted team members and decrease the ranks of those that aren’t trusted. 
The goal is to create a high functioning agile team in which everyone shares the same values. The goal is to obviate the foremen because everyone has become a foreman.

当然，目标是增加值得信任的团队成员的数量，减少不值得信任的团队成员的数量。
我们的目标是创建一个高功能的敏捷团队，其中每个人都拥有相同的价值观。我们的目标是排除工头，因为每个人都成了工头。

But most teams aren’t high functioning Agile teams. Most teams are caught in a divisive struggle over disciplines, quality, and professionalism. 
Most teams need to draw a line in the sand and decide what their values are, and what disciplines, behaviors, and standards they will use to support those values. Most teams need to set, and then enforce, quality standards.

但大多数团队都不是高功能的敏捷团队。大多数团队都陷入了关于纪律、质量和职业精神的分裂斗争中。
大多数团队需要划定界限，决定他们的价值观是什么，以及他们将使用什么规程、行为和标准来支持这些价值观。大多数团队需要设置并执行质量标准。

The open-source committer model (i.e. using foremen) has been shown very effective at achieving those ends.

开源提交者模型(即使用工头)已经被证明在实现这些目标方面非常有效。

In this paper the term ‘foreman’ is used in it’s gender neutral form. No gender bias is intended by the author; nor should any be imputed by the reader.

在本文中，“工头”一词使用的是中性形式。作者没有性别偏见的意图;读者也不应归罪于任何事情。

### 3. 点评
Bob大叔阐述了，完美的敏捷团队，成员都是工头级别的人物，他认为这样的团队存在但是很少。
接着他介绍了开源提交者模式，这种模式开源的作者属于工头级别，工头负责接受并合并其他成员的提交。
最后，他又介绍了教练模式，通过教练的训练可以让团队成员达成一致。

每种模式都有自己的优缺点，Bob大叔认为开源提交者模式对于实现软件工程目标非常有效。
