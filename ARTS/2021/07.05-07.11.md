## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
49. 字母异位词分组
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给定一个字符串数组，将字母异位词组合在一起。字母异位词指字母相同，但排列不同的字符串。

示例:

输入: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
输出:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func groupAnagrams(strs []string) [][]string {
	var cm  = make(map[[26]int][]string)
	for _, str := range strs {
		ele := [26]int{}
		for _, s := range str {
			ele[s-'a']++
		}
		cm[ele] = append(cm[ele], str)
	}
	var result = make([][]string, 0, len(strs))
	for _, v := range cm {
		result = append(result, v)
	}
	return result
}
```
### 4. 说明
用长度为26位的数组作为map的key，遍历strs数组，给key赋值，再将字符串放入map中，最后遍历map将字符串放入二维数组。

The Frenzied Panic of Rushing

充忙的疯狂恐慌

Last week I wrote a blog entitled The Startup Trap in which I lamented the unfortunate tendency of developers in a startup to cast their disciplines aside in order to maintain the “high” generated by the illusion that effort is speed. 
I specifically mentioned TDD as one of those disciplines that startup developers sometimes eschew.

上周我写了一篇题为《创业陷阱》(The Startup Trap)的博客，在文中我哀叹了创业公司的开发人员有一种不幸的倾向，他们为了保持努力就是速度的错觉而抛弃了自己的原则。
我特别提到TDD是创业开发人员有时会回避的原则之一。

The response in support of the blog was gratifying. 
The response in denial (Yes, that’s the right word) of the blog was expected; 
though I was somewhat surprised by the vehemence and amplitude of the various pejoratives, barbs, insults, and other ad hominem statements. 
I suppose that people who are addicted to a “high” do not take kindly to those who challenge their ability to justify and maintain that “high”.

支持这个博客的回应是令人满意的。
博客的回应是否认(是的，这是正确的词)是意料之中的;
尽管我对各种贬义词、讽刺、侮辱和其他人身攻击的激烈程度感到有些吃惊。
我认为那些沉迷于“快感”的人不会友善地对待那些挑战他们证明自己并保持这种“快感”能力的人。

One of the most common threads, amongst the more reasonable of the complaints, was this:

最常见的，也是最合理的抱怨之一是:

In a startup, the business model is more important than the code.

在初创公司，商业模式比代码更重要。

This is correct; but the initial predicate is superfluous. 
The business model is always more important than the code. 
Great code, that doesn’t make or save money, isn’t very interesting to businesses.

这是正确的;但最初的谓词是多余的。
商业模式总是比代码更重要。
好的代码，既不赚钱也不省钱，对企业来说不是很有趣。

The business model argument, correct though it may be, is irrelevant to my original point. Coding disciplines, including TDD, do not impede the discovery of the business model. 
Or to say this more succinctly, TDD does not slow you down.

商业模式的论点虽然可能是正确的，但与我最初的观点无关。编码规则，包括TDD，并不妨碍商业模式的发现。
或者更简洁地说，TDD不会减慢您的速度。

Indeed, all of the complaints against my blog boiled down to the same invalid assumption: TDD is too slow.

事实上，所有对我的博客的抱怨都归结为一个无效的假设:TDD太慢了。

That’s BS. At least it’s BS for me. TDD does not make me slower, it makes me faster. It makes others I know faster too. I presume that it could make everyone faster.

这是废话。至少对我来说是废话。TDD不会让我变慢，而是让我变快。它也能让我更快地认识其他人。我认为它能让每个人都更快。

I’m not going to explore the reasons for that speedup here. There are many other articles, books, and blogs that try to explain it. 
For now I’ll just fall back on the old saws: Slow and steady wins the race. Anything worth doing is worth doing well. Sat ci sat bene. 
(It’s done fast enough when it’s done well.) Or to quote Brian Marick, “In code, it never pays to rush.”

我不打算在这里探究加速的原因。有许多其他的文章、书籍和博客试图解释它。
现在，我只能依靠老一套:稳中求进才能赢得比赛。任何值得做的事就值得把它做好。坐在我身边。
(只要做得好，就足够快了。)或者引用Brian Marick的话，“在代码中，匆忙永远不会有好处。”

As an example of one of these strange arguments about the business model, consider Greg Young’s response. 
This is a nice story about a business opportunity, the two week effort to make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and the subsquent 9 months of effort to re-do that code “right”. 
His point was that the code was profitable after two weeks, and scarcely any more profitable after the nine month effort; so the nine months was a waste.

作为这些关于商业模式的奇怪论点之一的一个例子，我们来看看格雷格•杨(Greg Young)的回应。
这是一个关于商业机会的很好的故事，我们花了两周的时间去创造一个最小可行产品(MVP)，然后花了9个月的时间去“正确地”重新编写代码。
他的观点是，代码在两周后就开始盈利了，而在9个月的努力之后，盈利几乎没有增加;所以这九个月是浪费。

Of course he’s right. The two weeks were what counted. 
The nine months were a giant pud-pull. 
Those nine months would have been better spent on something more profitable.

他当然是对的。这两周是最重要的。
九个月是一个巨大的泥潭。
把这九个月花在更有利可图的事情上会更好。

The logical flaw in Greg’s argument is the presumption that it would have taken him longer than two weeks to get the MVP done if he’d been using good disciplines. 
I reject that presumption entirely. I believe Greg could have gotten that MVP done in two weeks or less using good disciplines. 
Moreover, the resultant code would likely have been far more amenable to being improved by another two or three weeks of reasonable effort.

格雷格的论点的逻辑缺陷是假设如果他使用良好的规则，他将花费超过两周的时间来完成MVP。
我完全拒绝这种假设。我相信格雷格可以在两周或更短的时间内通过使用好的规则获得MVP。
此外，经过两三个星期的合理努力，所得到的代码可能更容易得到改进。

Now let me say this more directly. Good disciplines don’t slow you down. 
Indeed a discipline that slows you down is not a good discipline. TDD is a good discipline.

现在让我更直接地说。好的规则不会让你放慢脚步。
确实，让你慢下来的规则不是好的规则。TDD是一门很好的规则。

TDD does not take a two week MVP effort and turn it into nine months of auto-stimulation. Nor does refactoring. Nor does SOLID. Nor does pair programming. Nor does continuous integration. Nor do any of the other good disciplines out there.

Getting done right does not mean getting done slow. Getting done right means getting done fast. You will go faster if you do things right. You will go faster if you come down off the “high” generated by the illusion that effort is speed. You will go faster if you calm down, follow your disciplines, and refuse to rush.

Story Time
Greg told the story of his two week MVP. So now let me tell you the story of Langton’s ant.

The year was 2002 or thereabouts. James Grenning, I, and half a dozen Thoughtworkers were at an airport in New York waiting for a delayed flight back to Chicago. We’d been attending one of the early XP Universe conferences. James and I were in our early fifties. The TWers were all in their late twenties or early thirties.

In that conference, Kent Beck gave the closing keynote on the topic of emergent behavior. As he spoke the screen behind him showed a series of black and white pixels crawling around in a random way. At the end of his talk, as he made his final point about emergent behavior, the random nature of the pixels suddenly congealed into a repeating pattern that started at the center of the screen and crawled its way to the upper right corner. Kent said the algorithm was: Langton’s Ant, a simple cellular automaton with just two rules:

At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
James and I had just ordered Gin and Tonics from the airport bar and returned to the waiting area, when we saw a group of the TWers frantically working on their laptops. We asked someone what was going on, and were told that they were racing to see who could implement Langton’s Ant quickest.

James and I looked at each other, nodded, opened a laptop, and quietly began to pair-program. We followed our disciplines, wrote test-first, kept the code clean, got it working after a few minutes, and then closed the laptop. We looked up, and the young twenty-thirty-something TWers were still expending copious energies in a fit of frantic coding. The frenzied intensity of their effort, driven by the panic of potential loss, was evident in their gestures and expressions. We, the two fifty-something programmers, smiled, clinked our Gin and Tonics, and sat back to enjoy the show being put on by all those young turks who never even guessed that they had been calmly bested by two of their seniors who had the experience and wisdom to know that the only way to go fast is to go well.
