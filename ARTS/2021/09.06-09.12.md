```
示例 1:
[!qr](./images/0906_a_1.jpg)
```
输入：heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
输出：10
解释：最大的矩形为图中红色区域，面积为 10
```
[!qr](./images/0906_a_2.jpg)
```
输入： heights = [2,4]
输出： 4
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func largestRectangleArea(heights []int) int {
	var n = len(heights)
	var res = 0
	var stack = make([]int, 0)
	var temp = make([]int, n+2, n+2)
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		temp[i+1] = heights[i]
	}
	heights = temp
	for i := 0; i < len(heights); i++ {
		for len(stack) > 0 {
			tail := stack[len(stack)-1]
			if heights[i] < heights[tail] {
				stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
				curI := tail
				curH := heights[curI]
				if len(stack) > 0 {
					tail = stack[len(stack)-1]
					leftI := tail
					rightI := i
					curW := rightI - leftI - 1
					curS := curW * curH
					if curS > res {
						res = curS
					}
				}
			} else {
				break
			}
		}
		stack = append(stack, i)
	}
	return res
}
```
### 4. 说明
1. 用数组模拟栈；
2. 栈内元素是单调递增的；
3. 出栈计算面积，并判断是否大于当前结果；

### 2. 翻译
Oh Foreman, Where art Thou?

哦，工头，你的艺术在哪里？

The response to my previous blog: Where’s the Foreman has been mixed. 
While the vast majority of folks seemed to agree; there was a vocal minority of people, whom I respect, who were quite negative. 
The thing that most of these people hated the most was my insistence that the foreman be the only person with commit rights.

对我上一篇博客：“工头在哪里”的回应不一。
尽管大多数人都似乎同意这一点；有一小部分人直言不讳，他们是我尊敬的人，他们都很消极。
这些人最讨厌的是我坚持认为工头是唯一拥有提交权的人。

The complaints were all based on the notion of team vs. foreman. 
Those who disagreed with my blog seem to feel that a software team is based on egalitarian rules, where all are peers, and none has authority over others. 
Nearly all of these people call themselves coaches; which is odd because, of all the roles in a team, the role of coach is the least egalitarian. 
The coach is special.

这些埋怨都是基于团队对比工头的概念。
那些不同意我博客的人似乎觉得软件团队是建立在平等主义规则的基础上的，所有人都是同伴，没有人对其他人有权威。
几乎所有这些人都称自己为教练;这很奇怪，因为在一个团队的所有角色中，教练的角色是最不平等的。
教练是特别的。

Some of these coaches pointed out to me that the role of a coach (as opposed to a foreman) is to teach, to anticipate problems and set up “learning moments”, to help the team “grow”. 
Actually, quite a few people used the term “grow”. Is there any way to be less of a peer, than to be the agent of “growth”?

其中一些教练向我指出，教练(而不是工头)的角色是教授，预测问题，建立“学习时刻”，帮助团队“成长”。
实际上，不少人用了“成长”这个词。除了成为“成长”的推动者，还有什么办法能让我们不那么像同伴呢?

My point here is that a coach is not a peer. 
A coach takes responsibilities that the other team members do not. 
And, therefore, the coach has authority that the other team members do not.

我想说的是教练不是同伴。
教练承担其他团队成员不必承担的责任。
因此，教练拥有其他团队成员没有的权威。

The Perfect Team

完美的团队

Now, for a moment, let’s imagine the perfect team. 

现在，让我们想象一些完美的团队。

All the team members are enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and compatible. 

所有的团队成员都是热情的、知识渊博的和兼容的。

They write tests. They pair. Their code is clean. 

他们编写测试。他们两人。他们的代码很干净。

They work from iteration to iteration, getting lots done. The customer is happy. 

他们从一个迭代工作到另一个迭代，完成了很多工作。顾客很满意。

The coach has nothing to do except watch, and plan for future growth. All is well.
In such a team, who has commit privileges? 
Obviously everyone does; because everyone works well with each other and everyone trusts each other. 
No one in this team commits bad code. No one on this team commits code without tests. So all have commit privileges.

教练除了观察和计划未来的增长，什么也不做。一切都好。
在这样的团队中，谁拥有提交的权限?
显然每个人都有；因为每个人都能很好地合作，每个人都互相信任。
这个团队中没有人提交糟糕的代码。这个团队中没有人在没有测试的情况下提交代码。所有人都有提交权限。

Do such teams exist? 
For brief moments, yes. 
But no team stays in this state forever. 
Humans are messy. 
Things happen. 
And corrective action must sometimes be taken.

这样的团队存在吗?
在短暂的时刻，是的。
但没有团队永远保持这种状态。
人类是混乱的。
趣事环生。
有时必须采取纠正措施。

The Story of Ron

罗恩的故事

Last week Ron was a functioning member of our “perfect team”; but Ron just screwed up big time. 
For the last few days he didn’t come in to work at all. He worked from home instead. 
He had a task to complete, and he committed it last night at 3AM. Clearly he wasn’t pairing. 
The code is crap. There are no tests. And nobody but Ron knows this because nobody expects the problem.

上个星期，罗恩还是我们“完美团队”中的一员。但是罗恩把事情搞砸了。
过去几天他根本没来上班。他在家工作。
他有一项任务要完成，昨晚凌晨3点他就完成了。很明显他不是搭档。
代码是垃圾。没有测试。除了罗恩，没人知道这一点，因为没人料到会有这个问题。

Of course the coach calls Ron and asks if everything is OK. Ron says he’s a little under the weather, but should be back in the office soon. 
Satisfied, the coach reports to the team; and everyone remains confident, enthusiastic, and ignorant of the time bomb that has been put into the commit stream.

教练当然会打电话给罗恩，问他是否一切都好。罗恩说他有点不舒服，但应该很快就会回到办公室。
满意后，教练向团队汇报;每个人都保持着自信、热情，却不知道那颗定时炸弹已经被扔进了承诺流。

As promised, Ron returns a few days later. But something is different about him. Oh, the old Ron shows through from time to time. Some days are perfectly normal. 
Other days, however, Ron is withdrawn, depressed. It’s obvious that something is wrong; and it’s obvious that Ron is trying to overcome it.

按照承诺，罗恩几天后回来了。但他有些不同。哦，原来的罗恩时不时地出现。有些日子是完全正常的。
然而，其他日子里，罗恩孤僻、抑郁。很明显有什么地方不对劲;很明显，罗恩正在努力克服它。

The coach talks with Ron about it. Ron simply says there are some personal problems that he’d rather not share; and that things are going to be OK soon.

教练和罗恩谈论这件事。罗恩只是说有些个人问题他不想分享;事情很快就会好起来的。

When Ron pairs with others, he’s a bit more passive than usual; but is still helpful. He sometimes gets very engaged, just like he used to. Everyone expects that his troubles will pass.

当罗恩和别人搭档时，他会比平时更被动一些;但仍然是有帮助的。他有时很忙，就像以前一样。每个人都希望他的麻烦会过去。

What they don’t know is that when Ron works alone, he cannot muster the will to write tests, to refactor, to clean the code. 
What they don’t know is that all his mental energy is being expended in keeping up appearances. 
He’s barely got enough left to get his own tasks working, let alone clean and tested. Nobody sees the stream of commits that is reducing the code coverage. 
Nobody sees the crappy code that is coupling the system. Nobody sees the disease that’s beginning to eat at the structure of their system.

他们不知道的是，当Ron独自工作时，他无法鼓起勇气来编写测试、重构、清理代码。
他们不知道的是，他所有的精力都花在了装门面上。
他几乎没有足够的钱来完成自己的任务，更不用说清理和测试了。没有人看到减少代码覆盖率的提交流。
没有人看到耦合系统的糟糕代码。没有人看到疾病开始侵蚀他们的系统结构。

Because of their trust in their “perfect team”, they are all but blind to the suffering of their team member. 
You see, what they don’t know, is that Ron’s wife has been diagnosed with Cancer.

因为他们对“完美团队”的信任，他们对团队成员的痛苦视而不见。
他们不知道的是，罗恩的妻子被诊断出患有癌症。

Clearly Ron’s troubles are going to continue for some time. 
Unfortunately the team, in it’s blind faith in it’s own perfection, will not detect the corruption in the code for some time. 
Gradually they will begin to see their coverage numbers decline. They’ll see strange and intermittent failures of the integration test suite. 
They’ll note that certain modules are becoming more and more error prone, and harder and harder to change.

显然，罗恩的麻烦还会持续一段时间。
不幸的是，团队盲目地相信自己的完美，在一段时间内不会检测代码中的损坏。
逐渐地，他们将会看到他们的覆盖率下降。他们将看到集成测试套件的奇怪和间歇性的失败。
他们会注意到某些模块变得越来越容易出错，而且越来越难更改。

And then it will be discovered. Someone on the team will trace back the commits that are causing the troubles, and they’ll realize that they are all coming from Ron. 
They also realize that repairing the mess will require weeks; and that they can’t trust Ron to do it. Indeed, they can’t trust Ron at all. 
Schedules have to be revised. Customers must be notified. There is anger. There is recrimination.

然后它就会被发现。团队中的某个人将跟踪导致问题的提交，他们将意识到这些提交都来自罗恩。
他们也意识到，修复这个烂摊子需要数周时间;他们不能信任罗恩去做这件事。事实上，他们根本不能相信罗恩。
日程安排必须修改。必须通知客户。有愤怒。相互指责。

In disgrace, Ron resigns.

罗恩不光彩地辞职了。

Reviso

检讨

Now, let’s play this out again. But this time, let’s imagine that the coach is just a little smarter, and a little less trusting than before. 
Let’s say that the coach takes seriously the responsibility for technical quality, and understands that good people sometimes do bad things. 
So our coach, let’s call her Jessica, reviews every commit. This isn’t a public thing. Jessica just does this as part of her job. 
There’s no formal review, no document trail, no daily report. Jessica just looks at every single commit, looking for problems.

现在，让我们再玩一遍。但这一次，让我们想象教练比以前更聪明一点，少一点信任。
让我们假设教练认真对待技术质量的责任，并明白好人有时会做坏事。
所以我们的教练，姑且叫她杰西卡吧，会检查每一个提交。这不是公开的事情。杰西卡这么做只是她工作的一部分。
没有正式的审查，没有文件记录，没有每日报告。杰西卡只是查看每一次提交，寻找问题。

And, of course, Jessica finds Ron’s first bad commit within hours. 
So she’s on the phone to him, asking him why he committed code without tests, code that had not been refactored. 
Ron says he’s a bit under the weather but that everything will be fine soon. He promises to fix the commit before the end of the day.

当然，杰西卡在几个小时内就发现了罗恩的第一次错误。
于是她打电话给他，问他为什么没有经过测试就提交了代码，那些代码还没有被重构。
罗恩说他有点不舒服，但很快就会好的。他承诺在今天结束之前完成提交。

Jessica accepts this, but starts to pay closer attention to Ron’s commits. 
Ron, aware that Jessica is watching, tries his best; but can’t muster the emotional energy to keep up appearances and keep the code clean. 
He never does fix that commit. He avoids pairing. He starts to miss deadlines. There’s no place for him to hide.

杰西卡接受了这一点，但开始更加关注罗恩的提交。
罗恩知道杰西卡在看着他，便竭尽全力;但却没有足够的情感来维持表面形象，保持代码整洁。
他从来没有解决过这个问题。他避免配对。他开始错过最后期限。他无处可藏。

The whole team can now see that something is very wrong with Ron. 
Jessica confronts Ron with the evidence. Bad commits. Missed deadlines. “What’s going on, Ron?”

整个团队现在都知道罗恩有问题。
杰西卡拿着证据和罗恩对质。糟糕的提交。错过最后期限。“怎么回事，罗恩?”

The truth about Ron’s wife comes out. The team rallies around Ron. 
Tasks are redistributed. Ron’s load is lightened. The team survives.

关于罗恩妻子的真相大白了。团队都团结在罗恩周围。
任务重新分配。罗恩的负担减轻了。团队生存。

Thank goodness Jessica was watching!

谢天谢地，杰西卡也在看!

Coach or Foreman?

教练还是工头?

Are these two really the same role? Of course they are! 
After all, the coach of a sports team is also the foreman of that team. 
The coach sets up training and practices schedules. The coach designs the playbook. 
The coach chooses the menu of plays for a particular game. 
The coach chooses which players are on the field, and when. 
And the coach can bench a player for infractions. The coach has commit rights!

这两个角色真的是一样的吗?当然是!
毕竟，一个运动队的教练也是该队的工头。
教练制定训练和练习时间表。教练设计战术手册。
教练为特定的比赛选择比赛菜单。
教练选择哪些球员上场，什么时候上场。
教练可以让违规的球员坐冷板凳。教练有权利!

Now, perhaps you are a coach, but you aren’t technical. 
That’s OK, coaches often have assistant coaches to help them. 
And the coach can delegate responsibilities and authorities to those assistants. 
So if you are one of those coaches who is a process expert, but not a coding expert; 
you’re going to need a coding expert to act as foreman.

也许你是个教练，但你不懂技术。
没关系，教练通常会有助理教练来帮助他们。
教练可以将责任和权力下放给助理教练。
如果你是一个流程专家，但不是编码专家的教练;
你需要一个编码专家来当工头。

Commit Rights? Really?

提交权利？真的吗？

Of course! But look, in a well functioning team, the foreman/coach doesn’t have to withhold commit privileges. 
In a well functioning team the foreman allows everyone to commit, and then simply, and silently, reviews the work. 
If someone does a great job, an attaboy is appropriate. If someone does a poor job, a private conversation, followed by remedial action, is appropriate. 
In the normal case, everyone on the team can commit.

当然!但是，在一个运作良好的团队中，领班/教练不需要保留特权。
在一个运作良好的团队中，领班允许每个人做出承诺，然后简单地、安静地审查工作。
如果某人工作做得很好，一个表扬是合适的。如果有人做得不好，私下谈话，然后采取补救措施，是合适的。
在正常情况下，团队中的每个人都可以提交。

But the foreman is the only one with the right to commit. 
What that means is that if Angela is the foreman, she can revoke your permission to commit and reduce you to issuing pull requests. 
This would, of course, be a rare occurrence; based on extreme misbehavior or malfeasance. A good foreman would rarely use that power; but the power must be there.

但工头是唯一有权提交的人。
也就是说，如果安吉拉是工头，她可以撤销你提交的许可，让你只能发出请求。
当然，这种情况很少发生;基于极端的不当行为或渎职。一个好的工头很少使用这种权力;但权力必须存在。

New team members ought not be granted commit privilege right away. 
It would be wise to have them earn that privilege by demonstrating their good work through pull requests for the first few iterations. 
Once earned, and appropriately celebrated, the new team member knows they are truly part of the team.

新团队成员不应该立即被授予提交权限。
明智的做法是让他们通过在前几个迭代中拉出请求来展示他们的优秀工作来获得这种权限。
一旦赢得并适当地庆祝，新团队成员就知道他们是团队真正的一部分。

In large teams, a foreman will have to find assistants to help. 
Those assistants will review every commit. The foreman will do spot checks.

在大型团队中，工头必须找助手帮忙。
这些助手将审查每一个提交。工头将进行抽查。

Is this really so strange?

这真的有那么奇怪吗?

No, actually, it’s not. It’s the way good work gets done. Would you sail on a ship, or fly in an airline, without a captain? 
Would you build a house without a general contractor? Would you run a sports team without a coach who had the power to bench the players? Would you create an orchestra without a conductor? 
Would you produce a movie without a director? Would you fight a war without a general?

不，其实不是。这是完成好工作的方式。你会在没有船长的情况下坐船或坐飞机吗?
你会在没有总承包商的情况下建造房子吗?如果没有一个有权让运动员坐冷板凳的教练，你会管理一支运动队吗?你会创建一个没有指挥的管弦乐队吗?
你会制作一部没有导演的电影吗?你会在没有将军的情况下打仗吗?

No, of course not. We’ve learned that lesson the hard way too many times. 
The truth about teams is that teams only function well when there is a competent leader that holds the commit rights.

不，当然不是。我们已经吸取了太多的教训。
关于团队的真相是，只有当有一个有能力的领导拥有提交权利时，团队才能正常运作。

### 3. 点评
Bob大叔本篇文章的核心观点是工头和教练是一类人，工头不必是啥都精通，但必须要有相应的权利，能够对团队负责，确保团队朝正确的方向前进。

* 当一个手机想上网的时候，先要连接eNodeB；
* 通过S1-MME接口，请求MME对手机进行认证和鉴权；
* eNodeB和MME之间的连接就是正常的IP网络，采用的是SCTP协议；
* SCTP也是传输层协议，更加适合移动网络；
* SCTP继承了TCP较为完善的拥塞控制并改进TCP的一些不足之处；
* SCTP引入了联合（association）的概念，将多个接口、多条路径放到一个联合中来；
* 当检测到一条路径失效时，协议就会通过另外一条路径来发送通信数据；
* 应用程序甚至都不必知道发生了故障、回复，从而提供更高的可用性和可靠性；
* SCTP将一个联合分成多个流，一个联合中的所有流都是独立的，但均与该联合相关；
* 每个流都给定了一个流编号，它被编码到SCTP报文中，通过联合在网络上传送；
* SCTP通过四次握手，防止SYN攻击；
* SCTP可以通过四次握手引入Cookie的概念，来有效地防止SYN攻击的产生；
