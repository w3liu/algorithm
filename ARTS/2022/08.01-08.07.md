### 1. 题目
```
621. 任务调度器
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给你一个用字符数组 tasks 表示的 CPU 需要执行的任务列表。其中每个字母表示一种不同种类的任务。任务可以以任意顺序执行，并且每个任务都可以在 1 个单位时间内执行完。在任何一个单位时间，CPU 可以完成一个任务，或者处于待命状态。

然而，两个 相同种类 的任务之间必须有长度为整数 n 的冷却时间，因此至少有连续 n 个单位时间内 CPU 在执行不同的任务，或者在待命状态。

你需要计算完成所有任务所需要的 最短时间 。

 

示例 1：

输入：tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
输出：8
解释：A -> B -> (待命) -> A -> B -> (待命) -> A -> B
     在本示例中，两个相同类型任务之间必须间隔长度为 n = 2 的冷却时间，而执行一个任务只需要一个单位时间，所以中间出现了（待命）状态。 
示例 2：

输入：tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
输出：6
解释：在这种情况下，任何大小为 6 的排列都可以满足要求，因为 n = 0
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
诸如此类
示例 3：

输入：tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
输出：16
解释：一种可能的解决方案是：
     A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> (待命) -> (待命) -> A -> (待命) -> (待命) -> A
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func leastInterval(tasks []byte, n int) (minTime int) {
	stat := map[byte]int{}
	for _, t := range tasks {
		stat[t]++
	}

	nextValid := make([]int, 0, len(stat))
	rest := make([]int, 0, len(stat))
	for _, v := range stat {
		nextValid = append(nextValid, 1)
		rest = append(rest, v)
	}

	for range tasks {
		minTime++
		minNextValid := math.MaxInt64
		for i, v := range rest {
			if v > 0 && nextValid[i] < minNextValid {
				minNextValid = nextValid[i]
			}
		}
		if minNextValid > minTime {
			minTime = minNextValid
		}
		best := -1
		for i, r := range rest {
			if r > 0 && nextValid[i] <= minTime && (best == -1 || r > rest[best]) {
				best = i
			}
		}
		nextValid[best] = minTime + n + 1
		rest[best]--
	}
	return
}
```

### 2. 翻译
Type Wars

类型战争

My son, Justin, and I have begun a new video series on cleancoders.com investigating mobile apps using swift. 
Learning swift has been an interesting experience. The language is very opinionated about type safety. 
Indeed, I don’t remember using a language that was quite so assiduous about types.

我和儿子贾斯汀(Justin)在cleancoders.com网站上开始了一个新的视频系列，调查使用swift的移动应用程序。
学习swift是一种有趣的经历。该语言对类型安全非常固执己见。
事实上，我不记得使用过这样注重类型的语言。

For example, the fact that a variable of type X might also be nil means you must declare that variable to hold an “optional” value by using a ?. [e.g. myVariable: X?] 
The language tightly constrains how that optional value is used. For instance, you cannot reference it without either checking for nil with an if or asserting with a ! that it is not nil. [e.g. myVariable!.myFunc()]

例如，事实上，X类型的变量也可能是nil，这意味着您必须声明该变量保存一个“optional”值使用?
语言严格限制了可选值的使用方式。例如，你不能引用它没有检查nil与一个if或断言与一个!它不是nil。

The extreme nature of the type system in swift got me thinking about the “Type Wars” that our industry has been fighting for the last six decades. 
And that got me to thinking that I should blog about the history of those wars, and then predict the future outcome. So, here goes: Don’t Panic.

swift的这种极端的类型系统让我想起了过去六十年来我们行业一直在战斗的“类型战争”。
这让我想到，我应该把这些战争的历史写在博客上，然后预测未来的结果。所以，请记住:不要惊慌。

WARNING: This history has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate.

警告:这段历史有很多遗漏，包含很多杜撰，或至少是非常不准确的。

The issue of types actually predates computers. In the last half of the nineteenth century, Gottlob Frege developed a logical system with which he hoped to derive all of mathematics from first principles. 
His work was the progenitor of predicate calculus; but it was found to have a critical flaw. 
On the eve of publication, Bertrand Russel wrote to Frege and pointed out that Frege’s logical system allowed statements that were ambiguous – neither false nor true. 
Frege was devastated and included the following remark in an appendix to his work.

类型的问题实际上早在计算机出现之前就存在了。在19世纪后半叶，弗雷格开发了一个逻辑系统，他希望用这个系统从基本原理推导出所有的数学。
他的工作是谓词演算的鼻祖;但它被发现有一个严重的缺陷。
在出版前夕，伯特兰·罗素写信给弗雷格，指出弗雷格的逻辑系统允许模棱两可的陈述——既不假也不真。
弗雷格深受打击，在他的作品的附录中写道:

“Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished. 
This was the position I was placed in by a letter of Mr. Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion.”

“对于一个科学作家来说，最不幸的事情莫过于他的著作完成后，他的大厦的一个基础被动摇了。
当这本书快要印完的时候，伯特兰·罗素先生的一封信把我置于这样的境地。”

One of the solutions that was proposed to resolve the problem was the notion of types. 
It was hoped that if the types of the parameters within Frege’s logical statements could be constrained, then Russell’s ambiguities could be eliminated. 
But in 1931 these hopes were dashed by Kurt Godel’s incompleteness theorems.

为解决这个问题而提出的解决方案之一是类型的概念。
人们希望，如果弗雷格逻辑语句中的参数类型能够得到约束，那么罗素的二义性就可以消除。
但在1931年，这些希望被库尔特·哥德尔的不完备定理破灭了。

This was the mathematical world that Alan Turing was active in. 
He, and other mathematicians like John Von Neumann, and John Backhus, who were steeped in these issues, were also responsible for many of the founding concepts of computer science, and our first languages – like Fortran.

这是艾伦·图灵活跃的数学世界。
他和约翰·冯·诺伊曼(John Von Neumann)、约翰·巴克胡斯(John Backhus)等深入研究这些问题的数学家，也为计算机科学的许多创始概念，以及我们的第一种语言——比如Fortran——做出了贡献。

I first ran into the concept of types in 1966 while learning Fortran as a teenager. 
My father had managed to acquire some very early manuals on languages like Fortran, Cobol, and PL/1; and I was devouring them. (Though I didn’t have access to a computer!)

我第一次接触到类型的概念是在1966年，那时我还是一个十几岁的少年，正在学习Fortran语言。
我父亲掌握了一些早期的语言手册，比如Fortran、Cobol和PL/1;我把它们吞了下去。(虽然我没有电脑!)

In Fortran there were essentially two types. Fixed Point (integer), and Floating point. 
In the original language the type was denoted by the first letter of the variable. 
Variables that began with the letters I through N (the first two letters in the word “integer”) were fixed point. 
All other variables were floating point.

在Fortran语言中，基本上有两种类型。定点(整数)和浮点。
在原始语言中，类型由变量的第一个字母表示。
以字母I到N(单词“integer”的前两个字母)开头的变量是定点的。
所有其他变量都是浮点数。

Expressions in Fortran could not “mix modes”. You could not have integers alongside floating point numbers. Only certain library functions could translate between the modes.

Fortran中的表达式不能“混合模式”。你不能把整数和浮点数放在一起。只有某些库函数可以在模式之间转换。

As a young programmer, without access to a computer, I found this very confusing. 
I wondered why such a distinction, with such horrific constraints, was so important. 
It wasn’t until I learned assembly language that I began to understand.

作为一名年轻的程序员，我无法使用电脑，这让我感到非常困惑。
我想知道，为什么这样的区分，伴随着如此可怕的限制，如此重要。
直到我学会了汇编语言，我才开始明白。

During my first years as a programmer, I wrote a bit of Fortran, Cobol, and PL/1; but I was much more focussed on assembler. 
I felt the “high-level” languages were bloated, slow, cop-outs. Real programmers wrote assembler – or so I thought. But then in 1977 I was introduced to C.

在我做程序员的最初几年里，我写过一些Fortran、Cobol和PL/1;但我更关注汇编程序。
我觉得“高级”语言是臃肿的，缓慢的，逃避的。真正的程序员写汇编程序——至少我是这么认为的。但是在1977年，我被介绍给了C。

It was an instant love-affair. 
As I sat by the campfire in my back yard, reading a copy of Kernighan and Ritchie, I cheered this language that was not a bloated, slow, cop-out; but was, instead, a simple translation of assembler.

这是一见钟情。
我坐在后院的篝火旁，读着一本《克尼汉与里奇》，我为这种语言而欢呼，它不是一种臃肿、缓慢、逃避的语言;而是汇编程序的简单翻译。

C, of course, had types; but they were not enforced in any way. 
You could declare a function to take an int, but then pass it a float or a char or a double. 
The language didn’t care. It would happily push the passed argument on the stack, and then call the function. 
The function would happily pop its arguments off the stack, under the assumption that they were the declared type. 
If you got the types wrong, you got a crash. Simple. Any assembly language programmer would instantly understand and avoid this.

C语言当然有类型;但它们并没有以任何方式得到执行。
你可以声明一个接受整数的函数，然后传递给它一个浮点数、一个字符或一个双精度浮点数。
语言并不在意。它会很高兴地将传递的参数推入堆栈，然后调用函数。
如果参数是声明的类型，函数会很高兴地从堆栈中弹出参数。
如果你错了类型，你就会崩溃。简单。任何汇编语言程序员都会立即理解并避免这一点。

The late 70s was the first time I realized that there was a war going on. A war about types. 
Although I had been completely enthralled by C I was aware of another contender for my attention: Pascal. 
Pascal was everything I hated about high level languages. I considered it to be a bloated, slow, cop-out. 
People who programmed this language were not real programmers because they depended on the language to keep them safe. 
Pascal, you see, was strongly typed.

70年代末，我第一次意识到有一场战争正在进行。一场关于类型的战争。
虽然我已经完全被C迷住了，但我意识到另一个竞争者:Pascal。
Pascal是我最讨厌的高级语言。我认为这是一种臃肿、缓慢的逃避。
编写这种语言的人并不是真正的程序员，因为他们依赖这种语言来保证自己的安全。
Pascal，你看，是很强的类型。

In Pascal if you declared a function to take certain argument types, then you had to call that function with those types. 
The language enforced type safety. For an assembly language programmer like me, in my twenties, this was just too constraining. 
Pascal, I felt, was a language for babies.

在Pascal中，如果你声明一个函数接受特定的参数类型，那么你必须用这些类型调用那个函数。
语言加强了类型安全。对于像我这样20多岁的汇编语言程序员来说，这太拘束了。
我觉得Pascal是婴儿的语言。

Apparently many programmers agreed with me because C won that language war; and won it decisively. The early ’80s was the heyday of C. 
As mini-computers proliferated, so did C. Pascal survived, but only because Apple decided (wrongly) to use it as the language for the Macintosh – a decision it would eventually reverse.

显然，许多程序员都同意我的观点，因为C语言赢得了这场语言战争;并且赢得了决定性的胜利。80年代初是C语言的全盛时期。
随着微型计算机的激增，C. Pascal也幸存了下来，但这只是因为苹果决定(错误地)使用它作为麦金塔电脑的语言——这个决定最终被推翻了。

There were other languages bubbling up from time to time; but they weren’t taken too seriously. We heard about Smalltalk, and the million dollar machines required to run it. 
We knew of Logo, Lisp, and several other languages. But in my part of the world, we were happy with C and couldn’t imagine anything better.

还有其他的语言不时冒出来;但他们并没有被太当回事。我们听说过Smalltalk，以及运行它所需的数百万美元的机器。
我们知道Logo、Lisp和其他几种语言。但在我的世界里，我们对C很满意，没有比这更好的了。

Objective-C popped up around 1986 or so. I remember looking pretty seriously at Brad Cox’s odd little hybrid between C and Smalltalk. 
But it was C++ that captured my attention. It captured my attention because, after the better part of a decade of C’s ambivalence towards types, I was ready for a language to enforce strong typing.

Objective-C出现在1986年左右。我记得我很认真地看着布拉德·考克斯(Brad Cox)那套集C语言和Smalltalk于一身的古怪小玩意儿。
但吸引我注意的是c++。它引起了我的注意，因为在C语言对类型的矛盾态度长达十年的大部分时间之后，我已经准备好使用一种加强强类型的语言。

You see, I had learned my lesson. As programs grew ever more complicated in the late 70s and early 80s, the problem of keeping your types straight began to get out of hand. 
There were too many times that I debugged problems in the field, only to find that someone had called a function with a long that was declared to take an int.

你看，我已经吸取了教训。在70年代末和80年代初，随着程序变得越来越复杂，保持类型正确的问题开始变得难以控制。
我多次调试字段中的问题，结果发现有人调用一个声明为接受int值函数传入了long类型的值。

So when Stroustup published his book on C++, I was ready! (I was also glad that this was a C derivative, so that I didn’t have to admit to the Pascal weenies that they’d been right all along!)

所以当Stroustup出版他关于c++的书时，我已经准备好了!(我也很高兴这是一个C的衍生物，这样我就不用向帕斯卡的小傻瓜们承认他们一直以来都是对的!)

The pendulum had swung. The industry adopted C++ and the era of strong typing had begun. 
We C programmers, combat hardened and war weary, swore we’d never go back to the careless days of unenforced types.

钟摆摆了起来。行业采用了c++，强类型时代开始了。
我们C程序员，经过了艰苦的战斗，厌倦了战争，发誓我们永远不会回到没有强制类型的粗心的日子。

Meanwhile the Smalltalk programmers were scratching their heads wondering what the big deal was. 
You see, their language was also strongly typed; but their types were undeclared. 
In Smalltalk types were enforced at runtime. Type errors in Smalltalk did not lead to undefined behavior, as they did in C. 
The behavior in Smalltalk was very well defined. You got a type exception during execution.

与此同时，Smalltalk的程序员绞尽脑汁，想知道这到底是什么大问题。
你看，他们的语言也是强类型的;但它们的类型没有声明。
在Smalltalk中，类型是在运行时强制的。Smalltalk中的类型错误不会像在C中那样导致未定义的行为。
Smalltalk中的行为是非常明确的。在执行过程中出现了类型异常。

We in the C++ community felt that was simply the same as dereferencing a null pointer. 
After all, who cares if the software in the missile fails because of a type exception or a segmentation error?
Either way, the missile fails.

在c++社区，我们觉得这和解除空指针的引用是一样的。
毕竟，谁会在乎导弹中的软件是否因为类型异常或分割错误而失败呢?
不管怎样，导弹都失败了。

The late ’80s and early ’90s were a kind of “cold-war” between the static type-checking of C++ and the dynamic type checking of Smalltalk. 
Other languages rose and fell during this time; but those two broad typing categories pretty well defined them.

80年代末90年代初是c++的静态类型检查和Smalltalk的动态类型检查之间的一场“冷战”。
其他语言在此期间兴衰起伏;但这两大类很好地定义了它们。

Then the war got hot again. But this time it wasn’t just programmers in the streets carrying C and Pascal signs. 
This time it was a real war with heavyweight players. It was a war between IBM and Sun.

然后战争又开始升温。但这一次，不仅仅是程序员在街上举着C语言和Pascal语言的标语。
这一次是一场与重量级选手的真正战争。这是IBM和Sun之间的一场战争。

But to set the stage I have to tell you about the research done by Capers-Jones regarding the productivity of programmers using different languages. 
His study showed that Smalltalk programmers were much more productive than C++ programmers. Some people thought the difference was as much as 5X. 
Others thought it was more like 2X-3X. But nobody thought C++ programmers were more productive than Smalltalk programmers.

但是为了铺垫，我必须告诉你们Capers-Jones所做的关于使用不同语言的程序员生产力的研究。
他的研究表明Smalltalk程序员比c++程序员更有效率。有些人认为差异高达5倍。
其他人认为它更像是2-3倍。但是没有人认为c++程序员比Smalltalk程序员更有效率。

In light of this, IBM chose Smalltalk as the development language for the internet. 
They made a huge bet on this by developing IDEs, and frameworks, and all the necessary infra-structure. 
Sun, on the other hand, put their weight behind Java (which was just C++ Lite.)

有鉴于此，IBM选择了Smalltalk作为互联网的开发语言。
他们在这方面下了很大的赌注，开发了ide、框架和所有必要的基础设施。
另一方面，Sun把他们的重量放在Java(只是c++ Lite)后面。

The battle raged. But the deciding factor was types. 
Sun fielded rank upon rank of Java (nee C++) programmers and won that battle over IBM on the basis of type safety (the missile argument). 
On that day Smalltalk died as a language. (But don’t worry, the Smalltalkers got their revenge.)

激烈的战斗。但决定因素是类型。
Sun派出了一大批Java (nee c++)程序员，并在类型安全(导弹参数)的基础上赢得了与IBM的战斗。
就在那一天，Smalltalk作为一种语言消失了。（不过别担心，小人报了仇。）

And so, Java, and it’s bastard cousin C# became the languages of the internet; and held sway for two decades. 
But there was a lot going on behind the scenes.

因此，Java和它的私生子表亲c#成为了互联网语言;统治了二十年。
但在幕后有很多事情在发生。

You see, the Smalltalk programmers had solved the missile problem in their own unique way. 
They invented a discipline. Today we call that discipline: Test Driven Development.

你看，Smalltalk程序员已经用他们自己独特的方式解决了导弹问题。
他们发明了一门学科。今天我们称之为:测试驱动开发。

Using TDD, the Smalltalk programmers were assured that the missile would reach it’s target. 
In fact, they had much more assurance than the type-checking of the C++ or Java compiler could provide. 
So when Smalltalk died, a fifth column of Smalltalk programmers infiltrated the ranks of the Java programmers and began to teach TDD. 
Their goal: subversion.

使用TDD, Smalltalk程序员确信导弹会到达它的目标。
事实上，它们比c++或Java编译器提供的类型检查有更多的保证。
因此，当Smalltalk死后，第5列Smalltalk程序员渗透到Java程序员的行列，并开始教授TDD。
他们的目标:颠覆。

You see, when a Java programmer gets used to TDD, they start asking themselves a very important question: “Why am I wasting time satisfying the type constraints of Java when my unit tests are already checking everything?” 
Those programmers begin to realize that they could become much more productive by switching to a dynamically typed language like Ruby or Python.

您可以看到，当Java程序员习惯了TDD时，他们开始问自己一个非常重要的问题:“为什么我要浪费时间来满足Java的类型约束，而我的单元测试已经检查了所有的东西?”
这些程序员开始意识到，他们可以通过切换到动态类型语言(如Ruby或Python)来提高效率。

And that’s exactly what happened in second half of the first decade of the current millennium. 
Tons of Java programmers jumped ship and became dedicated dynamic typers, and TDDers. 
That ship-jumping continues to this day, spurred on by the fact that salaries tend to be higher for programmers of the dynamic languages.

而这正是本世纪头十年的后五年所发生的事情。
大量的Java程序员跳槽成为专门的动态类型和tdder。
这种“跳船”现象一直持续到今天，这是受动态语言程序员的薪水更高这一事实的刺激。

Oh, and I should tell you about one special unit of Smalltalk programmers who stayed at IBM planned their revenge against Sun. 
They executed that revenge by creating … Eclipse.

哦，我应该告诉你一个Smalltalk程序员的特殊团队，他们留在IBM计划报复Sun。
他们通过创造Eclipse来完成复仇。

And so here we are. The pendulum is quickly swinging towards dynamic typing. 
Programmers are leaving the statically typed languages like C++, Java, and C# in favor of the dynamically typed languages like Ruby and Python. 
And yet, the new languages that are appearing, languages like go and swift appear to be reasserting static typing? So is the stage for the next battle being set?

所以我们就在这里。钟摆正迅速转向动态类型。
程序员正在离开静态类型的语言，如c++、Java和c#，而选择动态类型的语言，如Ruby和Python。
然而，正在出现的新语言，像go和swift这样的语言似乎在重申静态类型?那么，下一场战争的舞台准备好了吗?

How will this all end?

这一切将如何结束?

My own prediction is that TDD is the deciding factor. You don’t need static type checking if you have 100% unit test coverage. 
And, as we have repeatedly seen, unit test coverage close to 100% can, and is, being achieved. What’s more, the benefits of that achievement are enormous.

我自己的预测是TDD是决定因素。如果您拥有100%的单元测试覆盖率，则不需要静态类型检查。
并且，正如我们反复看到的，单元测试覆盖率接近100%是可以实现的。更重要的是，这一成就的好处是巨大的。

Therefore, I predict, that as TDD becomes ever more accepted as a necessary professional discipline, dynamic languages will become the preferred languages. 
The Smalltalkers will, eventually, win.

因此，我预测，随着TDD越来越成为一门必要的专业学科，动态语言将成为首选语言。
“Smalltalk程序员”最终会赢。

So says this old C++ programmer.

这是一个老c++程序员说的。

### 3. 点评
Bob大叔本文主要讨论了动态类型语言与静态类型语言的发展历史，他认为随着TDD的发展，有足够多的单元测试之后，动态语言的优势将会变得更大。

### 使用信号管理Nginx的父子进程
* Nginx是一个多进程的程序，多进程之间进行通讯可以使用共享内存，信号等，但是我们在做进程间的管理时，通常只使用信号。
* master进程监控worker进程有没有发送CHLD信号；
* 操作系统规定，当子进程终止时会向父进程发送CHLD信号；
* master可以通过CHLD信号发现worker进程终止，然后再重新把worker进程拉起；
* master进程还可以通过接收一些信号，来管理worker进程；
* master进程可以接收：TERM,INT,QUIT,HUP,USR1,USR2,WINCH;
* TERM,INT,QUIT,HUP,USR1可以通过nginx命令行加上特定的命令向master进程发送命令；
* USR2,WINCH只能通过kill Linux命令行直接向master进程发送信号；也就是说我们需要找到master进程所在的pid，对这个pid直接发送USR2和WINCH;
* worker进程可以接收：TERM,INT,QUIT,HUP,USR1,WINCH;
* 通常不对worker进程发送信号，而是对master进程进行管理；master收到信号后，会去再把信号发送给worker进程；
