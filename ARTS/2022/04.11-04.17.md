## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
347. 前 K 个高频元素
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给你一个整数数组 nums 和一个整数 k ，请你返回其中出现频率前 k 高的元素。你可以按 任意顺序 返回答案。

示例 1:

输入: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
输出: [1,2]
示例 2:

输入: nums = [1], k = 1
输出: [1]
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func topKFrequent(nums []int, k int) []int {
	var numMap = make(map[int]int)
	var arrMap = make(map[int][]int)
	var arr = make([]int, 0)
	for _, n := range nums {
		if v, ok := numMap[n]; ok {
			numMap[n] = v + 1
		} else {
			numMap[n] = 1
		}
	}
	for k, v := range numMap {
		if val, ok := arrMap[v]; ok {
			arrMap[v] = append(val, k)
		} else {
			arrMap[v] = []int{k}
			arr = append(arr, v)
		}
	}
	arr = insert(arr)
	n := len(arr)

	results := make([]int, 0)
	for i := 0; i < k && i < n; i++ {
		v := arr[n-i-1]
		results = append(results, arrMap[v]...)
	}
	return results[:k]
}

// 插入排序
func insert(arr []int) []int {
	if len(arr) <= 0 {
		return arr
	}
	for i := 1; i < len(arr); i++ {
		for j := 0; j < i; j++ {
			if arr[i] < arr[j] {
				temp := arr[i]
				for k := i; k > j; k-- {
					arr[k] = arr[k-1]
				}
				arr[j] = temp
				break
			}
		}
	}
	return arr
}
```
### 4. 说明
采用两个map分别记录数字出现的次数以及次数对应的数组，然后再对arr进行排序。最后返回results

The First Micro-service Architecture

第一个微服务架构

In the early 1960s IBM created the 1401 computer. It was wildly popular and exceeded all revenue projections. 
IBM built 2,800 of them in the first year (1960), and built over 15,000 of them overall. 
They typically rented for $7,000 per month (~$42,000 in todays dollars) and would have sold (if selling had been an option) for several million dollars.

20世纪60年代早期，IBM发明了1401型计算机。它非常受欢迎，并且超出了所有的收益预期。
IBM在第一年(1960年)就建造了2800台，总共建造了15000多台。
他们通常以每月7000美元(相当于现在的42000美元)的价格出租，并以数百万美元的价格出售房子(如果可以出售的话)。

The 1401 had a clock rate of around 88khz, and as much as 16,000 bytes of core memory. 
Not 16,384, mind you, 16,000. The machine addressed it’s memory in decimal. 
Some installations had magnetic tape drives; but many had nothing more than a card reader, card punch, and a line printer. 
The card reader could read 800 cards per minute. The punch could punch 250 cards per minute. The line printer could print 600 lines per minute.

1401的时钟频率约为88khz，核心内存多达16000字节。
不是16384，注意，是16000。这台机器以十进制计算内存地址。
有些装置有磁带驱动器;但许多公司只有读卡器、打孔机和行式打印机。
这个读卡器每分钟可以读800张卡。这台打孔机每分钟能打孔250张卡片。行式打印机每分钟可以打印600行。

A 1401 with 8,000 bytes, and no tape drive, could run the FORTRAN compiler. 
The compiler would read in your FORTRAN program from the card reader, and then punch a self-loading binary executable deck of cards.

一个8000字节的1401，没有磁带驱动器，可以运行FORTRAN编译器。
编译器将从读卡器读入FORTRAN程序，然后打孔自加载的二进制可执行卡片组。

If you had 8000 bytes, and had to write a FORTRAN compiler, how would you do it? 
Remember that compilers generally have to make multiple passes over the source code in order to do their work. 
So how would you structure the program so that it could pass over the code several times?

如果你有8000个字节，并且必须写一个FORTRAN编译器，你会怎么做呢?
请记住，编译器通常必须对源代码进行多次传递才能完成它们的工作。
那么，如何构造程序，使其能够多次传递代码呢?

Typical Multi-pass Compiler

典型的多程编译器

The obvious choice might be to load the whole compiler into memory, leaving just enough space for some working storage for the symbol table and IO buffers. 
Thus, if you had a three pass compiler, then on pass one, you would read in the FORTRAN source code, and then punch an intermediate deck that was (hopefully) somewhat smaller than the first deck. 
Then you’d start pass two, and read in the intermediate deck, and punch another (hopefully smaller) intermediate deck. 
Finally, you’d start pass three, and read in the final intermediate deck in order to punch the loadable binary deck. 
…And that’s if there were just three passes. What if there were 5? or 10?

显而易见的选择可能是将整个编译器加载到内存中，为符号表和IO缓冲区留下足够的工作存储空间。
因此，如果您有一个三遍编译器，那么在第一次编译时，您将读入FORTRAN源代码，然后输入一个(希望)比第一次编译器小一些的中间编译组。
然后你将开始第二次传递，并读取中间牌组，并打出另一个(希望更小)中间牌组。
最后，您将开始第3次传递，并读取最后的中间组，以便插入可加载的二进制组。
如果只有三次的话。如果有5个呢?还是10 ?

Think of the limitations of this system. How big is the compiler? 
How much space do you need in order to hold the symbol table? 
How many cards (80 bytes each) can you read in to your input buffers. 
What size output buffer do you need to punch the intermediate cards? 
And how much time is going to be spent by the operator, shuttling cards from the punch back to the reader, over and over again, for each pass?

想想这个系统的局限性。编译器有多大?
你需要多少空间来容纳符号表?
您可以将多少卡(每个80字节)读入您的输入缓冲区。
你需要多大的输出缓冲区来打孔中间的卡片?
每一次，操作员要花多少时间，把卡片从打孔机转回阅读器，一遍又一遍?

Let’s say you’ve got a thousand line FORTRAN program. How long is pass 1? 
Let’s assume that the intermediate deck is 80% the size of the source deck. 
So you’ve got to punch 800 cards at 250 per minute. You also have to read 1000 cards at 800 per minute. You can do that math. 
It’s just over 4 minutes of IO time. And remember, with an 88khz clock rate, computation time was likely significant. 
Each pass would be a bit shorter than the one before it; 
but given operator time, and the possibility of a handing error (dropping the cards) we can estimate that our 1,000 line FORTRAN program would require several minutes per pass, keeping the operator busy the whole time. 
A five pass compilation might require an hour of dedicated operator time; and a lot of wasted intermediate cards. Not to mention wear and tear on the card punch.

假设你有一千行FORTRAN程序。第一关多长时间?
让我们假设中间牌组的大小是源牌组的80%。
所以你要以每分钟250张的速度打800张卡。你还必须以每分钟800张的速度阅读1000张卡片。你可以算一下。
只有四分钟多一点的IO时间。记住，对于88khz的时钟速率，计算时间可能非常重要。
每一关都会比前一关短一点;但是，如果给定操作员的时间，加上处理错误(丢弃卡片)的可能性，我们可以估计，我们的1000行FORTRAN程序每次通过将需要几分钟，使操作员一直忙个不停。
5次编译可能需要一个小时的专用操作时间;还有大量浪费的中间牌。更不用说打卡机的磨损了。

Microservices

微服务

But that’s not what the plucky folks at IBM did. They used an entirely different approach. 
They read the source code in once, and held the entire source program in memory! 
They made Sixty three passes over the source code; and they did that by using microservices. They called them phases.

但这并不是IBM那些勇敢的人所做的。他们采用了一种完全不同的方法。
他们只读取一次源代码，并将整个源代码程序保存在内存中!
他们对源代码进行了63次传递;他们通过使用微服务来做到这一点。他们称之为阶段。

Almost all the memory in the computer was used to store the source code. They held back a few hundred bytes for the executable phases. 
If you get rid of all the extra blanks, the comments, and other non-essentials, you can hold a pretty big program in 7000+ bytes.

计算机中几乎所有的内存都用来存储源代码。他们为可执行阶段保留了几百个字节。
如果去掉所有多余的空格、注释和其他不必要的内容，那么一个相当大的程序就只需要7000+字节。

Each compiler phase averaged 150 instructions. Each was read in from the card reader (or mag tape if you had it). 
Each phase would make a pass over the source code, replacing that source code with smaller intermediate results. 
So from phase to phase, as the source code took up ever less space, there was ever more working storage for symbol tables and variables. 
When each phase was complete, the next phase would be read in from the card reader (or tape) and executed. 
The final phase punched the output result (or wrote it to tape).

每个编译阶段平均有150条指令。每一个都是从读卡器(或者磁带，如果你有的话)读取的。
每个阶段都会传递源代码，用更小的中间结果替换源代码。
因此，从阶段到阶段，由于源代码占用的空间越来越少，符号表和变量的工作存储空间越来越大。
当每个阶段完成后，下一个阶段将从读卡器(或磁带)读入并执行。
最后一个阶段打孔输出结果(或将其写入磁带)。

What did these phases do? You can read about the details here. 
In short, these phases swept through the source code, reorganizing it, eliminating redundancy, shortening keywords, replacing variables with addresses, 
replacing function and subroutine references with addresses, and gradually, inexorably grinding that source code down into binary code.

这些阶段做了什么?你可以在这里阅读详细信息。
简而言之，这些阶段横扫源代码，重新组织它，消除冗余，缩短关键字，用地址替换变量，用地址替换函数和子例程引用，并逐渐地无情地将源代码压缩成二进制代码。

I have just one word for that. Incredible.

我只有一个词来形容。难以置信的。

Imagine breaking down the problem of compilation into 62 different programs, each of which can run only once. 
Each of which must run in the memory vacated by the previous program. Each of which must consume the output of the previous, and prepare the input to the next.

想象一下，把编译问题分解成62个不同的程序，每个程序只能运行一次。
每一个都必须运行在前一个程序空出的内存中。每个组件都必须使用上一个组件的输出，并准备下一个组件的输入。

Of course these little programs were microservices, and the compiler used a microservice architecture – in 1960.

当然，这些小程序是微服务，编译器使用的是微服务架构——在1960年。

Which just goes to show that there’s nothing new under the Sun.

这表明，太阳底下没有什么新鲜事。
