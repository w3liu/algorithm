## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
448. 找到所有数组中消失的数字
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给你一个含 n 个整数的数组 nums ，其中 nums[i] 在区间 [1, n] 内。请你找出所有在 [1, n] 范围内但没有出现在 nums 中的数字，并以数组的形式返回结果。

 

示例 1：

输入：nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
输出：[5,6]
示例 2：

输入：nums = [1,1]
输出：[2]
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func findDisappearedNumbers(nums []int) []int {
	arrs := make([]int, len(nums)+1)
	arrs[0] = 1
	for _, v := range nums {
		arrs[v] = 1
	}
	var rets []int
	for i, v := range arrs {
		if v == 0 {
			rets = append(rets, i)
		}
	}
	return rets
}
```
### 4. 说明
将nums的数字遍历存入到arrs中，其中arrs的索引值就是nums的元素值。最后遍历arrs，找出v为0的就是元素索引组合起来就是结果。

### 2. 翻译

Agile is not now, nor was it ever, Waterfall.

敏捷现在不是，过去也不是，瀑布。

I read Agile is the new Waterfall at first with disgust, then with horror, and then finally with a meager amount of very qualified approval.

当我读到《敏捷是新的瀑布》时，我先是感到厌恶，然后是恐惧，最后是少量非常有资格的认可。

The author makes a reasonable point towards the end; 
but in getting to that point he states a number of falsehoods and eventually discredits a philosophy and discipline that does not deserve it. 
He is close to throwing everything out with the bathwater.

最后作者提了一个合理的观点；
但为了达到这一点，他提出了许多错误，并最终诋毁了一种不值得的哲学和纪律。
他几乎要把所有东西连同洗澡水一起倒掉。

He begins by claiming that no sane person advocates waterfall. 
I don’t know what universe the author lives in; but in this universe there are quite a few people who advocate waterfall. 
Are they sane? By any legal standard they are. Anyone who thinks that the battle against waterfall is over simply hasn’t been fighting in the right trenches.

他一开始就声称没有一个理智的人会提倡瀑布。
我不知道作者生活在哪个世界;但在这个世界上，有相当多的人提倡瀑布。
他们是理智的吗？以任何法律标准来看，它们都是。任何认为与瀑布的战斗已经结束的人都没有站在正确的战壕里。

If you want to get a feel for just how wrong the author is about this, 
just google “Waterfall Software Teams” and count the number of articles that talk about striking a balance, or mixing the two processes, etc. 
People are not anxious to give up on the past.

如果你想感受一下作者的观点有多错误，
只需要谷歌一下“瀑布软件团队”，并计算讨论如何平衡或混合两个过程的文章的数量，等等，
人们并不急于放弃过去。

Next he quotes MacBeth’s lament over the futility of life, and equates it with the “the promise of Agile”

接下来，他引用了麦克白对生命的徒劳的哀叹，并将其等同于“敏捷的承诺”。

“…full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”

“……充满了声音和愤怒，却毫无意义。”

I take rather profound exception to the idea that the events leading up to the Agile Manifesto, and the Manifesto itself are an example of futility and meaningless noise. 
The author wasn’t there. The author doesn’t know. While I agree that in certain circles there is more heat than light; 
to claim that the entire movement is insignificant is to ignore a vast swath of software history.

我对“敏捷宣言”的产生有着深刻的异议，而“宣言”本身就是一个无用和无意义的例子。
作者不在那里。作者不知道。虽然我同意在某些圈子里热比光多;
声称整个运动微不足道就是忽视了软件历史的一大片。

I’m not going to critique the author point by point. 
Suffice it to say that he knows very little of the history, and what little he does know he’s gotten wrong. 
In so doing he has cast a pall of disrespect over a large number of people who have made huge contributions to our field. 
A pall that discredits an ideology that has had a profoundly positive effect.

我不打算逐点批判作者。
我只想说，他对历史知之甚少，而他所知道的那一点点都是错的。
他这样做是对许多为我们这个领域做出巨大贡献的人的不尊重。
一种曾产生深远积极影响的意识形态的抹黑。

He rails against the Agile consultancies who try to help organizations make the shift to Agile. 
Some of his complaints are justified; but most are not. Changing an organization is hard! 
Those companies that try to change, and hire help to make that change, are courageous.

他斥责那些试图帮助组织转向敏捷的敏捷顾问。
他的一些抱怨是有道理的;但大多数都不是。改变一个组织是困难的!
那些试图改变的公司，并聘请帮助来实现这种改变的公司，是有勇气的。

Are there Agile consultancies that are better than others? 
Yes. Certainly. Caveat Emptor! But denigrating the entire effort is simply ignorant.

有比其他公司更好的敏捷咨询公司吗?
是的。当然有。购者自慎!但诋毁整个努力是无知的。

The One Point.

有一点。

The author is wrong about Agile in virtually every regard. 
But he does make one good point. Unfortunately the context in which he makes that point is so wrong that the point is almost lost in the cacophony of blather that surrounds it. 
That point is:

作者对敏捷的看法几乎在所有方面都是错误的。
但他说的有一点很好。不幸的是，他提出这一观点的背景是如此错误，以至于这一观点几乎湮没在围绕它的嘈杂的废话中。
这一点是：

“Bring in the bare minimum amount of process.”

“引入最简单的流程。”

Yes! Of course!

对！当然！

Does every software team need the entire suite of agile practices? Of course not. But let’s look at them:

每个软件团队都需要一整套敏捷实践吗?当然不是。但让我们来看看它们:

The Planning Game. 
Over the years it has become very clear that there are many ways to shave this Yak. 
Some teams need more process around this than others. 
For some, a simple list of features will do. 
For others, a Kanban board will be sufficient. 
Still others will need the full suite of stories, and tasks, and releases, and story points, and… Well, you know. 
Choose wisely!

计划游戏
这些年来，人们已经清楚地知道，有很多方法可以给牦牛剃毛。
有些团队需要比其他团队更多的流程。
对于一些人来说，一个简单的功能列表就可以了。
对于其他人来说，看板就足够了。

Customer Tests. Lots of customers don’t want to be bothered with these tests. 
That’s a shame, since they are demonstrably the best way to specify requirements. 
For those teams that have customers engaged enough to specify the requirements in terms of Cucumber tests, or FitNesse tests there is no better alternative. 
Teams that are not so fortunate are not likely to benefit from this practice. 
My personal rule is: If the customers neither read nor write the tests, then high level unit tests written in code suffice.

客户测试
许多客户不想为这些测试而烦恼。
这是一种遗憾，因为它们显然是指定需求的最佳方式。
对于那些有足够客户参与的团队来说，就黄瓜测试或FitNesse测试而言，没有更好的替代方案。
不那么幸运的团队不太可能从这种实践中获益。
我个人的原则是:如果客户既不读也不写测试，那么用代码编写的高级单元测试就足够了。

Small Releases. It’s hard to imagine a team that would not benefit from this practice. Keep the releases small. 
The more time you wait between exposing the customers to the system, the more can go wrong.

小版本
很难想象一个团队不会从这种实践中受益。版本要小。
在将客户暴露给系统之间等待的时间越长，出错的可能性就越大。

Whole Team. 
Again, it’s hard to imagine a team that would not benefit from a close relationships between the business people, and the developers. 
Not all teams are so fortunate, of course.

完整的团队
同样，很难想象一个团队不会从业务人员和开发人员之间的密切关系中受益。
当然，并非所有团队都如此幸运。

Collective Ownership. 
As far as I’m concerned any team that has individual code ownership is deeply dysfunctional. 
If the owner of some part of the code decides to leave, the whole team is left in crisis mode. 
There are many ways to achieve collective ownership, but the bottom line is very simple. 
No single individual should be able to hold the team hostage. 
Every part of the code should be known by more than one person – the more the better.

集体所有制
就我所知，任何拥有独立代码所有权的团队都是非常不正常的。
如果某部分代码的所有者决定离开，那么整个团队就会陷入危机模式。
实现集体所有制的方法有很多，但最根本的是非常简单的。
任何一个人都不能挟持整个团队。
代码的每一部分都应该被不止一个人知道——越多越好。

Coding Standard. 
This simply goes along with Collective Ownership. 
The code should look like the team wrote it, not like one of the individuals wrote it. 
The members of the team should agree on the way that their code will appear. 
This isn’t rocket science.

代码规范
这与集体所有制是一致的。
代码应该看起来像团队编写的，而不是某个个人编写的。
团队成员应该就代码出现的方式达成一致。
这不是火箭科学。

Sustainable Pace. 
This is a real simple idea. Software projects are marathons, not sprints. 
You dare not run at a rate that you cannot sustain for the long term. 
Murphy tells us that any team that violates this practice is doomed to flame out at the worst possible moment.

可持续的速度
这是一个非常简单的想法。软件项目是马拉松，而不是短跑。
你不敢以你不能长期维持的速度跑步。
Murphy告诉我们，任何违反这种做法的团队注定会在最糟糕的时刻熄火。

Continuous Integration. 
Certainly there are teams who’s projects are so small that setting up a CI server is redundant. 
However, for most teams this is such a positive win that neglecting it would be immoral, if not insane.

持续集成
当然，有些团队的项目非常小，设置CI服务器是多余的。
然而，对于大多数球队来说，这是一场积极的胜利，忽视它将是不道德的，如果不是疯狂的。

Pair Programming. 
Some teams benefit greatly by using this practice. Others do not. 
For the latter, some form of code review is likely necessary. 
In any case, it is a very good idea for every line of code to have been seen by more than one pair of eyes.

结对编程
一些团队通过使用这个实践大大受益。别人不。
对于后者，可能需要进行某种形式的代码检查。
无论如何，让每一行代码都被不止一双眼睛看到是一个非常好的想法。

Simple Design. 
If we learned anything in the ’90s it is that over-design is suicide. 
The level of design is team dependent, of course; but the simpler the better is simply a good rule of thumb.

简单设计
如果说我们在90年代学到了什么，那就是过度设计就是自杀。
当然，设计水平取决于团队;但是越简单越好是一个很好的经验法则。

Refactoring. 
Does anybody really want to argue that programmers should not keep their code as clean as possible? 
Does anyone want to argue that code should not be improved with time? 
Teams may choose different degrees of refactoring; but zero is probably not acceptable.

重构
真的有人认为程序员不应该尽可能保持代码干净吗?
有没有人认为代码不应该随着时间的推移而改进?
团队可以选择不同程度的重构;但零可能是不可接受的。

Test Driven Development. 
This is certainly the most controversial of all the Agile practices. 
But the controversy is not about the word Test. 
Virtually everyone agrees that writing unit tests is important. 
Some of us think that the order in which they are written is important too. 
Different teams will choose different strategies. But teams that ignore testing are not destined for rapid success.

测试驱动开发
这无疑是所有敏捷实践中最具争议的。
但争议并不在于Test这个词。
几乎每个人都同意编写单元测试很重要。
我们中的一些人认为书写的顺序也很重要。
不同的团队会选择不同的策略。但是忽视测试的团队注定不会很快成功。

Conclusion
Does every team need every one of these practices? Certainly not. 
Do most teams need at least some of them? Of course they do! Again, choose wisely!

总结
每个团队都需要这些实践吗?当然不是。
大多数团队至少需要其中一些吗?当然了!再次,做出明智的选择!

I believe that the author of the original article was exposed to teams who were doing Flaccid Scrum and made the mistake that that’s all there was to Agile. 
He is correct that there have been some uninformed consultancies who have taught this poor variant of the Agile practices. In that sense his diatribe is understandable. 
Still, ignorance is no excuse. If you are going to impugn the character of good people and good ideas, you’d better do your damned homework.

我相信，原文章的作者接触过一些团队，他们在做Flaccid Scrum时犯了一个错误，认为敏捷就是这样。
他说的没错，有一些不知情的顾问教授了敏捷实践的这种糟糕变体。从这个意义上说，他的谩骂是可以理解的。
不过，无知并不是借口。如果你要质疑好人和好主意的品格，你最好做好你那该死的功课。
