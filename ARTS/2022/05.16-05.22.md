## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
437. 路径总和 III
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给定一个二叉树的根节点 root ，和一个整数 targetSum ，求该二叉树里节点值之和等于 targetSum 的 路径 的数目。

路径 不需要从根节点开始，也不需要在叶子节点结束，但是路径方向必须是向下的（只能从父节点到子节点）。

```
示例1：

[!qr](./images/0505_a_1.jpg)
```
输入：root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
输出：3
解释：和等于 8 的路径有 3 条，如图所示。
```
```
示例 2：

输入：root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
输出：3
```


### 3. 解答：
```golang

type TreeNode struct {
	Val   int
	Left  *TreeNode
	Right *TreeNode
}

func rootSum(root *TreeNode, targetSum int) (res int) {
	if root == nil {
		return
	}
	val := root.Val
	if val == targetSum {
		res++
	}
	res += rootSum(root.Left, targetSum-val)
	res += rootSum(root.Right, targetSum-val)
	return
}

func pathSum(root *TreeNode, targetSum int) int {
	if root == nil {
		return 0
	}
	res := rootSum(root, targetSum)
	res += pathSum(root.Left, targetSum)
	res += pathSum(root.Right, targetSum)
	return res
}
```
### 4. 说明
采用深度优先遍历+递归

WATS Line 54

长途电话54号线路

I had an interesting conversation with Doc Norton this morning. And it got me to thinking…

今天早上我和诺顿博士进行了一次有趣的谈话。这让我想到···

You know what an 800 number is. Some people call them “toll free”. The Telephone company call them WATS lines. Wide Area Telephone Service.

你知道800是什么。有些人称之为“免费通行”。电话公司称之为WATS线路。长途电话服务。

In 1976 I took a job at a company in the suburbs of Chicago. Teradyne Central it was called. 
We made test equipment for the telephone company. Our product was named 4-Tel. 
It tested every telephone line, in a telephone service area, every night. 
A telephone service area could have 100,000 lines or more.

1976年，我在芝加哥郊区的一家公司找到了一份工作。它被称为Teradyne中心。
我们为电话公司制造测试设备。我们的产品命名为4-Tel。
它每天晚上测试一个电话服务区的每条电话线。
一个电话服务区可能有10万条或更多的线路。

A 4-Tel system could have as many as 21 terminals tied to it. 
Each terminal could be used by a tester in the service area to test a telephone line anywhere in that service area. 
The test would detect and diagnose any problems on those lines; and could determine whether the problem was in the central office, in the lines themselves, or in the customer’s telephone. 
This was important because those three diagnoses were handled by different crafts. 
Dispatching the right craft to fix the problem saved a lot of money.

一个4-Tel系统可以有多达21个终端连接到它。
每个终端都可以被服务区的测试人员用来测试服务区任何地方的电话线。
测试将检测和诊断这些线路上的任何问题;并且能够确定问题是出在中心办公室，在线路本身，还是在客户的电话上。
这很重要，因为这三种诊断是由不同的技术处理的。
派遣合适的飞船来解决这个问题可以省下一大笔钱。

4-Tel had many other cool features. It was a rich product with a lot of use cases. And it was installed all over the United States.

4-Tel还有许多其他很酷的功能。这是一个包含大量用例的丰富产品。它被安装在美国各地。

When one of our customers had a problem, they would call an 800 number. 
This would automatically get routed to one of our two WATS lines. 
If it was normal business hours, our receptionist would answer the WATS line. 
Once she had ascertained that this was a customer service call, she would put the caller on hold, and then speak over our internal public address system:

当我们的客户遇到问题时，他们会拨打800电话。
这将自动路由到我们的两个WATS线路之一。
如果是正常营业时间，我们的接待员会接听WATS的电话。
一旦她确定这是一个客户服务电话，她就会让来电者等待，然后通过我们的内部公共广播系统说:

Would someone from software please pick up WATS line 54.

软件部门的人请接WATS 54号线。

If it was after hours, we in the lab would simply hear the WATS line ring.

如果是下班时间，我们在实验室里只会听到WATS的电话铃声。

No mater what time it was, we answered.

不管什么时候，我们都回答。

There were about a dozen of us on the programming staff. We’d look up at the nearest phone and see the blinking light labeled “54”. 
Whoever was closest to a phone would pick up that line. If it was me, I’d say:



Teradyne Central Software: This is Bob Martin

And then we’d proceed to listen to the issue, and we’d advise the customer what to do.

Sometimes, of course, it was cockpit error, which we could quickly correct. Sometimes it was a known flaw in our system for which we could communicate a workaround. And sometimes it was a new defect or problem that we had to diagnose on the spot.

One way or another we stayed on the phone with the customer until the problem was resolved.

Responsible Engineers.
You might be asking yourself why we didn’t have a customer service department handling those calls; and entering defects into a defect tracking system. The answer to that is simple. We felt responsible for the system. We wanted to know what our customers were experiencing. We didn’t want a layer of people insulating us from the problems that we were creating in the field.

We had a term at Teradyne: Responsible Engineer. That was the subhead under the signature line on every Engineering Change Order. We signed for the changes we made. We were the Responsible Engineers.

That term had meaning to us. We felt responsible. And so we did not want anything insulating us from the real world of our customer’s plight.

At Teradyne, we did our own QA. We did our own devops. We did our own customer service. And we frequently traveled to customer sites to work with the Field Service engineers.

In fact, it was common practice for each software developer to spend a day or two riding along with a telephone repairman; just so we could understand what these guys were up against, and how they really used our system.

Insulation
Modern software development teams are often highly insulated. They live in a world free from the distractions of customers and their “petty” problems. There are whole groups of people who serve to insulate developers from the real world. Customer Service. Q/A. Devops. You name it. And why do these groups exist? They exist because each of these are areas where software developers have failed so badly at that companies have had to defend themselves by creating whole new departments and management structures.

I think that’s a shame. How can you be a software craftsman if you don’t communicate with your real customer? How can you be a software craftsman if you don’t directly experience the nightmares you are creating for devops? How can you be a software craftsman if you leave all your bugs for QA to find?

Software Craftsmanship
It seems to me that a software craftsman is a Responsible Engineer. A Software Craftsman should never be insulated from the real world of the customer, of devops, of QA, or of anything else. The responsibilities of a team of software craftsmen should include QA; should include devops; should include customer service. And every member of that team should be able to cover for every other member.

There’s nothing wrong with specialization. There is a lot wrong with insulation.
