## Algorithm
### 1. 题目
```
581. 最短无序连续子数组
```
### 2. 题目描述
```
给你一个整数数组 nums ，你需要找出一个 连续子数组 ，如果对这个子数组进行升序排序，那么整个数组都会变为升序排序。

请你找出符合题意的 最短 子数组，并输出它的长度。

 

示例 1：

输入：nums = [2,6,4,8,10,9,15]
输出：5
解释：你只需要对 [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] 进行升序排序，那么整个表都会变为升序排序。
示例 2：

输入：nums = [1,2,3,4]
输出：0
示例 3：

输入：nums = [1]
输出：0
```

### 3. 解答：
```golang
func findUnsortedSubarray(nums []int) int {
	var cnt int
	sortedNums := make([]int, len(nums))
	_ = copy(sortedNum, nums)
	sort.Ints(sortedNum)

	var i, j = 0, len(nums) - 1

	for i <= j {
		if nums[i] == sortedNum[i] {
			cnt++
			i++
		} else if nums[j] == sortedNum[j] {
			cnt++
			j--
		} else {
			break
		}
	}
	return len(nums) - cnt
}
```
### 4. 说明
先排序，然后再对比头尾有多少是相同的，再用总长度减去首尾长度之和即可。

Manhandled

粗暴对待

Warning: Possible sexual abuse triggers.

警告：可能得性虐待诱因。

One of my regular bike-riding podcasts is Astronomy Cast, by Dr. Pamela Gay and Fraser Cain. 
Indeed, if you go to cleancodeproject.com you’ll see that Astronomy Cast is one of the charities on my list of favorites. 
Make a contribution and I will send you a green Clean Code wristband, or coffee cup, or sweatshirt. 
If you listen to Astronomy Cast you’ll also find that I am a sponsor.

我的一个固定的自行车播客是由帕梅拉·盖伊博士和弗雷泽·凯恩主持的天文学节目。
如果你去cleancodeproject.com，你会看到天文学演播是我最喜欢的慈善机构之一。
只要你做出贡献，我就会送你一个绿色的“干净代码”手环，或者咖啡杯，或者运动衫。
如果你听天文演播，你也会发现我是赞助人。

This podcast is always about science; and the science content is quite good. It’s techie. 
It’s geeky. It’s right up my alley. I’ve listened to almost every one of the 399 episodes. 
If you like science – especially science about space and astronomy, this is a great resource.

本播客总是关于科学的;而且科学内容也很好。
这是极客化的。这正合我的胃口。399集我几乎都听过了。
如果你喜欢科学——特别是关于太空和天文学的科学，这是一个很好的资源。

But yesterday was different. 
Yesterday was episode 399; and it was not about science at all. 
It was entitled: Women in Science; and it was about – sexual harassment.

但是昨天不同。
昨天是399集跟科学无关。
他的题目是：科学领域的女性，是关于性骚扰的。

Not the big kind that gets reported. Not the notorious kind that gets people fired. 
Not that kind – though there’s enough of that to go around. 
No, this was about commonplace, everyday, normal sexual harassment.

不是那种很大的报道。不是那种会让人被解雇的臭名昭著的。
不是那种——尽管这种东西已经够多了。

Honestly, I didn’t know there was such a thing. 
I’ve always thought that sexual harassment was anomalous behavior perpetrated by a few disgusting, arrogant men in positions of power. 
It never occurred to me that sexual harassment was an everyday, commonplace, run-of-the-mill, what-else-is-new occurrence. 
But I listened, aghast, as I heard Dr. Gay recount tales of it. 
Tales of the kind of sexual harassment that women in Science regularly encounter; and have simply come to expect as a normal fact of life.

说实话，我不知道还有这种事。
我一直认为性骚扰是由几个位高权重、令人厌恶、傲慢的男人犯下的反常行为。
我从来没有想过性骚扰是一件日常的、司空见惯的、普通的、其他都是新鲜事的事情。
但当我听到盖伊医生讲述有关它的故事时，我惊呆了。
科学领域的女性经常遭遇的性骚扰的故事;并将其视为生活的常态。

As just one example, [Time code 23:10] Dr. Gay recounts: 
“…because this was somebody who, when he was drunk, grabbed my boob at one point, as you do, at a conference, at a bar.”

举个例子，23:10盖伊博士叙述道:
“因为这是一个喝醉了的人，他一度抓住了我的胸部，就像你在会议上，在酒吧里做的那样。”

As you do? As you do? As who does? My mind is still reeling from this. 
She made it sound like it was a regular, normal, occurrence. 
Indeed, in a particularly gut-wrenching blog she wrote:

当你做什么?当你做什么?谁做?我还在纠结这件事。
她说得好像这是一件很平常的事。
事实上，她在一篇特别令人揪心的博客中写道:

“…we, like every other segment of society, have our share of individuals who, given the right combination of alcohol and proximity will grab tits and ass. 
I’ve had both body parts randomly and unexpectedly grabbed at in public places…“.

“我们，就像社会的其他部分一样，我们也有一部分人，只要酒精和距离合适，就会去摸别人的乳头和屁股。
我身体的两个部位都曾在公共场合被随意和意外地抓过……”

Who does something like that? 
What kind of low-life, scumbag, knuckle-dragging, troglodyte, behaves that way? Drunk or not? 
Didn’t their fathers ever teach them about respect?

谁会做这种事?
什么样的下贱人渣，卑鄙小人，穴居人，会这样做?喝醉了吗?
他们的父亲没教过他们尊重吗?

This is a huge disconnect in my mind. 
When I go to conferences I do not have people walking up to grope me. 
The fear that that might happen never enters my mind. 
So, for me, this kind of thing doesn’t exist. 
It’s not in my universe of experience.

这在我脑海中是一个巨大的脱节。
我参加会议的时候，不会有人走过来摸我。
我从未想过会发生这种事。
所以，对我来说，这种事情是不存在的。
这不在我的经验范围内。

And yet, Dr. Gay says that when she goes to a conference she has to make sure her rear is against a wall, 
and her arms are folded in front of her chest, just to ward off the potential gropes from drunken dipshits that she works with.

然而，盖伊博士说，当她去参加会议时，她必须确保自己的屁股贴着墙，
她的胳膊交叉在胸前，只是为了防止和她一起工作的醉鬼可能对她动手动脚。

I can’t imagine living like that – having to tolerate being manhandled – having to always be on guard against it. 
Having to wonder whether merely resisting it was harming my standing in the community; and harming my ability to earn a living.

我无法想象那样的生活——不得不忍受被粗暴对待——还要时刻警惕。
不得不怀疑仅仅是抵制它是否会损害我在社区中的地位;也损害了我谋生的能力。

And it made me think: Could this be happening in the software community as well? My community?

这让我想到:这也会发生在软件社区吗?我的社区吗?

Are women programmers being manhandled at their places of employment and at software conferences? 
Do they have to continually fend off unwanted pats, slaps, pinches, and gropes? 
Do they have to worry that their careers could be damaged by speaking out and defending themselves? 
In order to get along in this community do women have to pretend that such actions are just clumsy, harmless, fun-and-games instead of the wretched, disgusting actions that they actually are?

女性程序员是否在工作场所和软件会议上受到了粗暴对待?
他们是否需要不断地避开不必要的拍、拍、捏和摸?
他们有必要担心自己的职业生涯会因为直言不讳和为自己辩护而受到损害吗?
为了在这个社会中和睦相处，女性是否必须假装这样的行为只是笨拙的、无害的、好玩的，而不是她们实际上是卑鄙的、令人厌恶的行为?

So I did some research on this topic. I was horrified by what I found. 
The number of recorded events is large, and strikes very close to home. 
I was mortified to find that it has taken place at conference that I have attended. 
It turns out that women in our field have to deal with being manhandled, in one form or another, on a regular basis.

所以我就这个话题做了一些研究。我被我的发现吓坏了。
有记录的事件数量很大，而且打击非常接近我们的家。
当我发现这种事情发生在我参加的会议上时，我感到很羞愧。
事实证明，我们这个领域的女性经常要面对这样或那样的粗暴对待。

Here are just a few of the resources I’ve found:

以下是我找到的一些资源:

When Geeks Attack. More on this later.

当极客们的攻击。稍后再详细说明。

The Ada Initiative. Now defunct, but contains a lot of history about harassment and abuse in the software field.

《美国残疾人法》倡议。现在已经不存在了，但包含了很多关于软件领域的骚扰和虐待的历史。

Geek Feminism: Timeline of incidents. Much more detail about harassment episodes in software. Hell, I know more than one of the harassers mentioned here…

极客女性主义:事件时间线。关于软件中骚扰事件的更多细节。该死，我知道这里提到的骚扰者不止一个…

Although these lists contains hundreds of events; they list only those that were reported. 
If you read through a few of the references you’ll find an ubiquitous thread. 
The women interviewed say things like: “Something like this happens to me two or three times a year at a conference.” or “This one was bad, but I’ve had worse.” 
The undercurrent of these lists makes it plain that the lists are just the tip of a very large iceberg.

尽管这些列表包含了数百个事件;他们只列出那些被报道的。
如果你阅读了一些参考资料，你会发现一个普遍的线程。
接受采访的女性会说:“这样的事情每年都会在会议上发生两三次。或者“这个很糟糕，但我经历过更糟的。”
这些列表的暗流很明显地表明，这些列表只是巨大冰山的一角。

One very disturbing aspect of my research was the finding that many descriptions of harassment are referenced by third parties; 
but the primary articles by the victims and witnesses have been taken down by their authors. 
It’s as if the record of such occurrences has a lifetime; after which the information gradually disappears. 
Some authors explain the removal of their descriptions by replacing them with a message that says, in effect, that they needed to write it; but that it hurts too much to leave the record intact.

在我的研究中，一个非常令人不安的方面是，我发现许多关于骚扰的描述都是由第三方引用的;
但受害者和目击者的主要文章已经被作者撤下。
这类事件的记录似乎有一辈子的时间;之后，这些信息就会逐渐消失。
一些作者解释说，删除他们的描述时，他们用一条信息来代替，实际上，他们需要写它;但保留记录太伤人了。

This voluntary deletion implies that the damage done by these reprehensible actions is so significant that the victims, and first hand witnesses, cannot tolerate leaving the record intact.

这种自愿删去的做法意味着，这些应受谴责的行为造成的损害是如此严重，以至于受害者和第一手证人都不能容忍完好无损地保留记录。

I am convinced that most programmers do not engage in such overt harassment. 
I am also convinced, by the research I’ve done, that there are too many programmers and managers who do. 
Even more concerning is my fear that there are too many more who may turn a blind eye to it.

我相信大多数程序员不会进行这种公开的骚扰。
根据我所做的研究，我也确信，有太多的程序员和经理会这样做。
更令人担忧的是，我担心会有更多的人对此视而不见。

Some of the descriptions are heart wrenching depictions of women being obviously groped by a co-worker or boss in public, in plain view. 
Sometimes someone intervenes; and cudos to those folks. But it’s only sometimes.

书中有一些描述是令人心痛的，描述了女性在众目睽睽之下明显被同事或老板猥亵。
有时有人干预;感谢那些人。但这只是有时候。

There was a time when just under half of all programmers were women. Today that number is less than 10%. 
I’ve puzzled over this for years now, and even written about it. Why aren’t women becoming programmers? 
But if this kind of stomach turning behavior is common in our community, then the puzzle is solved. No wonder women avoid the field! No wonder at all. 
I imagine that they find out, very early on, that to stay in this field is to have to submit to being regularly manhandled by too many of their co-workers and bosses.

曾经有一段时间，几乎一半的程序员是女性。如今，这一数字不到10%。
多年来，我一直在思考这个问题，甚至写过相关文章。为什么女性没有成为程序员?
但如果这种让人反胃的行为在我们的社区中很常见，那么问题就解决了。难怪女人们都回避这个领域!这一点也不奇怪。
我想，他们很早就发现，要留在这个领域，就必须忍受经常受到太多同事和老板的粗暴对待。

The graphic above shows that women started leaving our field in droves right around 1985. Why would this be? 
If they are being driven out by the bad behavior of their co-workers, did that bad behavior begin just as computers were becoming household appliances, 
and the demand for programmers shot through the roof? Did it begin shortly after the average age of programmers began to decline by 10 years?

上图显示，1985年左右，女性开始成群结队地离开我们的领域。为什么会这样呢?
如果他们是被同事的不良行为赶走的，那么这种不良行为是否始于计算机成为家用电器、对程序员的需求激增之时?它是在程序员的平均年龄开始下降10年后不久开始的吗?

Along those lines I found this statement from the When Geeks Attack article to be insightful.

沿着这些路线，我发现当极客攻击文章中的这句话是有深刻见解的。

…the stereotypically introverted programmer – think of the Mark Zuckerberg portrayal in The Social Network – has evolved into a far more cocksure, frat-house kind of figure. 
These so-called brogrammers have reason to believe they can act with impunity: The demand for computer engineers is outpacing virtually every other industry in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
That has translated into six-figure salaries and over-the-top perks like concierges, car service, and free gourmet meals. 
Wall Street’s masters of the universe have been supplanted by Silicon Valley’s big-swinging code jocks. 
And thanks to the anonymity of the Internet, fueled by a dogmatic belief that all speech is free speech, they have made the very act of being a woman in the industry something of an occupational hazard.

……典型的内向程序员——想想《社交网络》中马克·扎克伯格的形象——已经演变成一个更加自信的、兄弟会式的人物。
这些所谓的程序员有理由相信他们可以不受惩罚:根据美国劳工统计局(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)的数据，对计算机工程师的需求几乎超过了美国其他所有行业。
这就带来了六位数的薪水，以及门房、汽车服务和免费美食等额外福利。华尔街的宇宙主宰者已经被硅谷的大摇大摆的代码高手所取代。
于互联网的匿名性，以及所有言论都是言论自由的教条信仰的推动，她们已经把女性在这个行业的行为变成了一种职业危害。

Is that it? Is it really about status and power? Is it really about the corruption that power breeds? 
Are there programmers who are so sure that they are indispensable, they feel immune from reproach? Do their “incredible brains”, and their “mastery over frameworks”, make them feel entitled to fondle?

就是这样吗？这真的与地位和权力有关吗?这真的是权力滋生的腐败吗?
是否有程序员如此确信自己是不可或缺的，他们觉得自己不会受到指责?他们“不可思议的大脑”和“对框架的精通”是否让他们觉得有权被爱抚?

If so, why aren’t women programmers sharing in this kind of status and power? Why is it denied to them? 
Is it because they don’t express power in terms of sexual harassment and abuse as much as men do?

如果是这样，为什么女性程序员不能分享这种地位和权力?为什么不给他们呢?
是因为她们不像男性那样在性骚扰和性虐待方面表达权力吗?

As I said of our industry in a recent blog:

正如我在最近的一篇博客中提到我们的行业:

“Power has a gender, and that gender is male.”

“权力是有性别的，而这个性别就是男性。”

Is that because men are able to intimidate women through commonplace sexual harassment?

这是因为男性能够通过常见的性骚扰来恐吓女性吗?

Look back at that red line on the graphic. Is that line the reciprocal of the amount of sexual harassment in our industry?

回头看看图表上的红线。这条线是我们行业性骚扰数量的倒数吗?

Professionalism.

专业主义

I write a lot about professionalism. So let me just say this for the record to all of you who want to be professional programmers:

我写了很多关于专业的文章。所以让我郑重地对所有想成为专业程序员的人说:

You never lay your hands on someone with sexual intent without their explicit permission. It does not matter how drunk you are. 
It does not matter how drunk they are. You never, ever manhandle someone without their very explicit consent. 
And if they work for you, or if you have power over them, then you must never make the advance, and must never accept the consent.

没有别人的明确许可，你绝对不会对有性意图的人动手。你喝多醉都没关系。
他们喝多醉都没关系。没有得到对方明确的同意，你绝对不能粗暴对待对方。
如果他们为你工作，或者你对他们有权力，那么你就永远不要前进，永远不要接受他们的同意。

What’s more: if you see harassment in progress, or even something you suspect is harassment, you intervene! 
You stop it! Even if it means you’ll lose a friend, or your job, you stop it!

更重要的是:如果你看到正在进行的骚扰，或者甚至是你怀疑是骚扰的事情，你要干预!
你停止它!即使这意味着你会失去一个朋友，或者你的工作，你也要停止!

One last thing:

最后一点：

To employers, team leads, and managers: No one is so indispensable that you should tolerate, or cover up, this kind of behavior. 
If it happens, and you can prove it, quick termination should be the result.

致雇主、团队领导和经理:没有人是不可或缺的，你应该容忍或掩盖这种行为。
如果这种情况发生了，并且你可以证明它，结果应该是迅速终止。

To the rest of you: If your employers do not act decisively in such matters, quit!

其余的人:如果你的雇主在这类事情上不果断行动，那就辞职!

Bob大叔这篇文章表达了他对职场性骚扰的看法，先从科学界普遍存在的性骚扰说起，再联系到软件行业，最后呼吁大家不要容忍这种事情，要敢于反抗。
