`Unless you’ve lived under a rock the past week, there was no way to avoid seeing the photos taken on the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pros. They’re impressive to say the least buy yet I’m still left feeling like they could be so much more.`

除非你上周躲在岩石下，要不然你不可能没有看见iPhone11 和 iPhone11 Pro 的图片。他们激动的说会有很少人会购买，但是我任然觉得他们会买很多。

`As the cameras on our Smartphones keep getting better and better, I wonder if the outcomes they serve are truly improving? In particular, I think of video calls.`
由于智能手机上的相机越来越好，我在想他们所提供的服务是否真的在改善。尤其是视频通话。

`Video calls, like FaceTime, are taking over how we communicate with one another.`
视频通话，就像FaceTime，正在取代我们彼此之间的交流方式。

`In fact, WhatsApp released a report in 2017 that stated their users make a staggering 55 million video calls per day along with a total of over 340 million video calling minutes per day. Those numbers are probably much larger now and even more impressive when you think of all of the various video calling tools like FaceTime, Duo, and others.`
实际上，WhatsApp 2017年发布了一个报告，称他们的用户每天打惊人的5500万次视频电话，每天视频通话总分钟数超过3.4亿。然而即使那些你能想到的糟糕的视频通话工具比如FaceTime,Duo等，这些数字现如今可能更加巨大了。

`Personally, for myself and my family, some of my most important connections are kept strong through video calling. My kids calling their grandparents, me calling my wife for visual feedback in the grocery store, catching up with an old friend, holding meetings at work and so many others are all done through video calling. I want better quality cameras for photo taking as much as anyone else but if I were to choose between photography and video calling, I wouldn’t hesitate to choose video calling.`
就我个人而言，我和我的家人之间的一些重要的联系都是视频通话来保持的。我的孩子与爷爷奶奶聊天，在杂货店通为了视觉体验与妻子聊天，与老朋友叙旧，召开工作会议等场景都是通过视频通话进行的。我也与大家一样想让拍出来的照片越来越好，但是如果在照片和视频通话中做选择的话，我会毫不犹豫的选择视频通话。

`Even with the role video calls serve today and the innovation of camera technology, our Smartphones are not focusing nearly enough on improving the quality of presence as they could be. Eye contact, in particular, I think is an area where great strides could be made in improving video communication. Eye contact provides another level of connection, a human one, that conveys more than speech and written text at times and that is just not comfortable today through video calling.`
尽管视频通话在今天扮演着重要的角色，而且摄像头技术也在不断创新，但我们的智能手机并没有将足够的精力放在提高显示质量上。尤其是眼神交流，我认为这是一个可以在改善视频通信方面取得重大进展的领域。眼神交流提供了另一种层次的联系，一种人类的联系，它有时传递的不仅仅是语言和文字，而现在通过视频通话就不太舒服了。

`How important is eye contact for video calls? It’s been proven that eye contact produces a powerful, subconscious sense of connection that extends even to drawn or photographed eyes. This was shown in a recent study by Researchers at Cornell University who manipulated the gaze of a cartoon rabbit on several Trix cereal boxes, and then asked a panel of adults to choose one. They discovered, as they expected, that the box most frequently chosen was the one on which the rabbit was looking directly at them, rather than away. One can only imagine how much more important they are for meaningful everyday conversations.`
视频通话中的眼神交流有多重要？事实证明，眼神交流会产生一种强大的潜意识联系，甚至延伸到被画或被拍的眼睛。康奈尔大学（cornell university）的研究人员最近进行了一项研究，他们将卡通兔子的目光操纵在几只trix麦片盒上，然后让一组成年人选择一只。他们发现，正如他们预料的那样，最常选择的盒子是兔子直接盯着他们看的盒子，而不是离开的盒子。人们只能想象，对于有意义的日常对话来说，它们有多重要。

`Don’t take my word for it, giants like Apple are starting to realize how important it is too.`
别相信我的话，像苹果这样的巨头已经开始意识到它的重要性。

`In iOS 13, Apple released a feature named “FaceTime Attention Correction” that uses image manipulation to automatically alter gaze.`
在iOS13中，苹果发布了一个名为“FaceTime注意力修正”的功能，它使用图像操作自动改变注视。

`It’s a neat trick and it’s still unknown how much it’ll help but it’s only a single step in the right direction.`
这是一个巧妙的伎俩，现在还不知道它会有多大帮助，但这只是朝着正确方向迈出的一步。

`As our cameras improve, we should demand more. We should ask for devices and features, both in software and hardware, that help us connect in more meaningful ways outside of just picture quality. Eye contact and other ways of feeling present is a missing focus in the tech industry and it’s on us to ask for these improvements with our voices and dollars.`
随着摄像机的改进，我们应该要求更多。我们应该要求设备和功能，无论是在软件和硬件，帮助我们连接在更有意义的方式以外的图片质量。眼神交流和其他感受当下的方式是科技行业缺少的一个焦点，我们需要用我们的声音和金钱来要求这些改进。
